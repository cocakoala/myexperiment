in 1998 , the yili autonomous prefecture cpc committee and the yili prefecture cpc committee made unified arrangements and sent on a trial basis several propaganda teams deep into the schools , villagers ' courtyards , and fields to carry out face - to - face propaganda among the people of all nationalities .
in many rural areas , the masses sat on the grassland , in the football fields , or under the trees and conscientiously listened to the propaganda lectures .
an old man from sadikeweizi village of sadikeweizi township in yining county firmly held a propaganda team member by hand , asking him to go to his house to give a lecture to his children . he said : " if only you had come here to give us propaganda lectures two years before !
yibulayin , a farmer from alamutuya village of yingyeer township in yining city , said : " a country is just like a family and the government is just like a parent . if the parent often teaches his children , his children will make fewer mistakes . "
when i first came here , i thought that it would be difficult for us to gather the villagers together and even if we could gather them together , some of them would leave the site before a propaganda lecture ended .
while carrying out the propaganda activity , the propaganda team members displayed a spirit of bearing hardships and enduring hard work .
in those seven days , in order to save time , they ate dry crusty pancakes and drank plain boiled water during the day and lived in the herdsmen 's yurts at night .
sometimes , they would especially rush to an area in order to give a propaganda lecture to only a few people .
apart from sparing no effort to carry out the propaganda activity from village to village , the propaganda team members also find time to help the local people tackle difficulties and problems in their production and livelihood and joined them in fighting the floods and providing disaster relief .
song jian , vice chairman of the national committee of the chinese people 's political consultative conference and president of the chinese academy of engineering , attended the appraisal meeting .

economists here maintain that the strategy of developing western china was a timely one .
according to the concept , central and western china should first give consideration to the national interests by supporting the opening up and development of coastal areas in the east .
then , when the east has reached a certain stage of development , it should help central and western china speed up its development with even more resources in return .
moreover , owing to the deflation trend , the state has adopted certain active fiscal policies to boost the economy , creating the situation where the government can afford to support the development of the west with even more resources .
according to zeng peiyuan , minister in charge of the state development planning commission , this year the government will draw up additional preferential policies for encouraging foreign businesses to invest in western china and will spend more loans from international organizations on construction projects in the west .
this year , the state will continue to tilt its investments toward western china , the next five - year plan will include a special plan for the development of the west , and the government will invest a larger percentage of money incurred from floating national bonds in projects in western china .
according to the experts , china 's economic development in recent years has been hindered by inadequate demand at home , and considerable portion of technology and labor are seeking new areas of production , new markets , and new areas of development .
china has basically addressed the problem of feeding the people . its food supply is higher than demand . this has created the rare opportunity for the development of western china .
our forefathers said : preparedness ensures success , and unpreparedness spells failure , which means that in doing everything , it is necessary to make thorough preparations and well - conceived plans .
the central authorities stressed that in developing the western region , things must be done in accordance with the scientific law , as the formulation of scientific and meticulous plans is both demanded by the intrinsic law governing the regional economic development , and has definite objectives in view .
making a scientific plan will help maintain unflagging enthusiasm and enhance the prudent and rational spirit , so that good intentions will reap good results and the large - scale development of the western region will obtain great achievements .
a scientific plan has both its guiding function and binding force .
to draw up an authoritative plan , we must also pay attention to coordination and comprehensive equilibrium .
as a dozen provinces , municipalities , and autonomous regions as well as the xinjiang production and construction corps are involved in the western development , various localities , especially the neighboring provinces , municipalities , and autonomous regions , must coordinate with one another in drafting plans .
if they only proceed from the interests of their own provinces , areas , or units regardless of the overall situation of the western development , they are unable to play a harmonious and resonant symphony for the development of west china .
the practice for many years has shown that even if we do things with good intentions , we must also fully respect the masses ' wishes , and only by arousing the masses ' enthusiasm to work with one heart can we initiate an excellent situation for the western development .
news that has recently spread here indicates that some localities in the western region have introduced or are studying the introduction of preferential policies , hoping to import funds from the eastern region and foreign countries through various methods .
once their doubts and misgivings are cleared , they will vie with one another to make bold investment in the western region .
therefore , making a good plan is conducive to creating a fully appealing investment environment .
scientific , complete water conservancy construction plans must be drawn up in accordance with the demands of the overall mission and overall goals of national economic and social development , and must be in line with overall planning for national economic and social development .
the ministry of water resources must draw up a comprehensive national plan for water conservancy construction development to be used in guiding the work of water conservancy nationwide .
flood prevention and development plans must also be drawn up for the major river basins .
at the same time , plans for various types of special projects must be put in place .
water conservancy projects within a river basin must all be carried out under the guidance of the overall plan and the plan for the river basin .
flood prevention is the primary mission , and it is also work that must be done frequently and diligently .
flood prevention must be integrated with water conservation , ecological protection , and pollution prevention and control .
in addition , non - engineering measures such as meteorology , hydrology , monitoring , communications , information systems , and the like must be strengthened .
water conservancy projects must establish management while placing emphasis on the right things , which means that while project quality must be taken seriously , maintenance and upkeep must also be strengthened .
proper handling requires making the relationships among what is possible , the current situation and the long - term .
according to the unified plan , major issues relating to the national economy and people 's livelihood and urgent problems are resolved first , and moreover are integrated with the fulfillment of long - range planning goals .
according to the request made by general secretary jiang zemin , we must insist on taking time to reach decisions , comprehensive consideration , scientific selections and comparisons , and meticulous designs for major water conservancy projects .
fourth , ensure project quality .
in the recent period of time , in accordance with requests from the central government and relevant national regulations , the ministry of water resources has taken a series of measures to strengthen project quality management , and has achieved remarkable success .
however , many problems still remain in water conservancy projects .
wen jiabao stressed that flood prevention and drought resistance relate to the lives , property , and security of the people , and must be given high regard at all times .
third , we must raise the level of modern flood - prevention and drought resistance technology .
establish modernized meteorological , hydrological , and communications facilities , strengthen analysis and research of rainfall and water conditions , and improve the accuracy of forecasting .
he called on the comrades at the national prevention office to be faithful in the discharge of their duties , diligent and responsible , and to serve selflessly to raise the scientific level and efficiency of the work .
the state council leadership group for west china development has an office subordinate to it ; a specific organ has been set up in the state development and planning commission , to undertake the day to day work of the leadership group .
china formally proposed implementing the strategy of major development of west china at the national economic work conference last year .
having been discussed until early this year , this major development strategy is gradually heating up . clues to the thinking on western development are also being gradually revealed .
during the exchanges and mutual visits , people of the same trades from the trade unions of both sides expressed their feelings of hope for reunification and opposition to separation .
to our regret , however , lee teng - hui [ li denghui ] openly trotted out the " two - state theory " when cross - strait relations were developing continuously , thus seriously undermining the foundation for the normal development of cross - strait relations and greatly damaging the interests of taiwan compatriots .
millions of staff and workers and trade unions at all levels throughout the country resolutely oppose this criminal act to split the motherland .
the principle of " one country , two systems " has been understood and accepted by more and more people .
the all - china women 's federation will continue to expand the exchanges and contacts with taiwan women and play its due role in achieving peaceful reunification of the two sides of the strait at an early date and opposing the splittist forces in taiwan .
history has proven and will continue to prove that only with the reunification of the motherland can the nation be revitalized comprehensively , and only with national unity can a more brilliant tomorrow be created .
bayinqolu said that in the new century , youths on both sides of the strait should cooperate and work hard together to attain the magnificent goal of the great rejuvenation of the chinese nation .
at the moment when we say goodbye to the old year and usher in the new year , the all - china federation of trade unions , the cyl central committee , and the all - china women 's federation extended spring festival greetings to the large numbers of laborers , youths , and women in taiwan .
what they regret , however , is that cross - strait ties have developed in tortuous fashion over the past five years .
chen zhengtong said that the taiwan people have a glorious patriotic tradition ; their aspirations to keep their way of life unchanged and to be masters in their own house are fully understood and respected by the cpc and the chinese people 's government .
this is because there is only one china , and taiwan is part of chinese territory ; this is undeniable fact , and no force can change in any way taiwan 's status as a part of chinese territory .
he greatly appreciated president jiang zemin 's remarks in the proposals on " strive to achieve peaceful reunification , chinese should not fight chinese . "
the taiwan people can only achieve happiness through reunification ; and only through reunification can the taiwan compatriots , together with the people of all nationalities in china , truly share in the international dignity and honor of the great motherland .
people on both sides of the strait entertain ardent hopes .
this is naked hegimonism and power politics , and an obvious violation against the three sino - us communiques . the attempts of anti - china politicians to obstruct china 's great cause of reunification by wantonly interfering in china 's internal affairs and backing up the splittist forces of " taiwan independence " is clearly disclosed .
tang jiaxuan notes in his message : china and the world need each other in their development .
it will come up with grand projects and accomplish them , and it will act as a good advisor and assistant to the cpc central committee and the state council .
- - the army , the police force , political - judicial organs , and party and government organs have stopped their involvement in business and in the running of enterprises , depriving some smugglers of their protection and shelter ; the effort against corruption has been intensified , echoing the antismuggling campaign .
the general administration of customs alone has investigated and handled 13 officials at the level of provincial department head or equivalent and 50 officials at the level of provincial section head or equivalent who have violated discipline and law .
- - measures for comprehensive improvement have been implemented and powerful joint forces have developed in the antismuggling campaign .
- - the law enforcement departments have continually conducted large - scale specialized antismuggling operations by focusing on key areas , key channels , and key commodities and kept up the high pressure on smuggling .
the responsible persons at customs emphasized that it is necessary to administer customs strictly and resolutely purge each and every " borer " discovered with no leniency whatsoever .
an effort should be made to significantly strengthen the leadership groups at various levels in the customs sector , significantly raise the quality of the cadre contingent , markedly improve their conduct and discipline , and effectively check the phenomena of corruption in law enforcement within the next two years .
his message reads : on the occasion of the joyous spring festival , i wish the motherland to be prosperous , wealthy , and strong , and the people happy and healthy .
now a task of top priority is to quickly build a mighty contingent of qualified personnel of various types who can meet the strategic needs of the massive development of the western region as well as a contingent of high - quality cadres .
to build a mighty contingent of qualified personnel of various types , it is necessary , above all , for the central authorities to make overall planning , to coordinate efforts to solve problems , and to rationally adjust the distribution and structure of qualified personnel , including the regional structure of quality personnel .
in coordination with relevant departments , the organization department of the cpc central committee is studying and making strategic planning for qualified personnel for the massive development of the western region , strengthening the backbone of the party and government leadership , and assigning high - standard professional personnel to the region through various channels .
by carrying out those measures , we should vigorously improve the age , educational , and professional structures of leading bodies at various levels in order to increase their vitality .
while continuing to do a good job in selecting and sending cadres to xinjiang and tibet , we should step up our efforts to train young cadres of various types to meet the needs of the development of the western region .
we should select in a planned way a number of outstanding young cadres for tempering themselves at central state organs or in economically developed areas with their original positions retained for them , in order to help them widen their field of vision , adopt new ideas , and increase their abilities .
in the past , as a result of rapid economic development and preferential policy on personnel in the eastern region , some qualified personnel in the western region went there to work .
efforts should be made to resolutely eliminate the corrupt phenomenon of spending public funds for wining , dining , and pleasure - seeking and to crack down on economic crimes of embezzling state development funds according to law , such as misappropriating public funds , embezzling public property , and striking deals between money and power .
the massive development of the western region will benefit future generations , and it has a bearing on the great cause of revitalizing the chinese nation in an all - round way . it will take longer - term , arduous efforts to accomplish the undertaking of massive development of the western region .
how can s & t training for troops be made scientific ?
guangzhou military region guided its officers and soldiers in adopting a concept of scientific training based on the demands of actual combat as the impetus , talented people as the foundation , s & t as the guide , the masses as the main body , and standardized execution of training .
the military region proposed that s & t training for troops must have instruction , scientific training , and scientific management .
these trainers employ new knowledge , new skills , new methods , and new measures as they execute 847 outstanding training subjects .
the military efforts were effective in improving the quality of s & t training for troops . in s & t training for troops , the guangzhou military region emphasizes transformation of the results of the training .
through the spread of training achievements , the achievements are transformed into overall unit combat power . since last year the military region has convened three onsite demonstrations of s & t training to research and discuss the s & t new training methods and new combat methods .
the revolution in science and technology that took place in the world economy at the end of the twentieth century , comprised of information technology , biomedicine , new materials , new energy , and aerospace technology , brought with it an inherent tendency toward accelerated development .
only by accelerating the development of high technology and its related industries will we activate the qualitative leap in industrial structures and technological standards and capacities that will transform china in the 21 st century from a great industrialized nation into an industrial power .
our reporter has learned from relevant sources within the china state planning commission that development of china 's high - tech industry will proceed in conformity with promoting economic and social development and stimulating structural adjustments and upgrading . currently , three main responsibilities have been identified : - - to accelerate the coordinated development of the information industry .
in the 20 th century , beginning from the early 1990 's , china 's information industry has consistently shown an annual growth rate of more than 30 percent , and this makes it one of the most rapidly developing sectors of the national economy .
it is for this reason that the market outlook for the information industry in china is so optimistic . it is estimated that by the year 2010 this industry 's market capacity will reach 6 trillion rmb .
for this reason we are selecting those key areas or key links that have favorable prospects , where the degree of industrial linkage will be significant , and which can drive the entire mechanism for critical breakthroughs , and through these we will vigorously strive to realize a leap in high - tech development .
this type of interdependence and mutual stimulus would be difficult to ignore .

accompanied by the villagers ' representative , tung chee - hwa and his wife looked over the ancestral hall of the chung family .
tung chee - hwa and his wife conveyed new year 's greeting to the whole family . the family greeted the chief executive and his wife , and treated them to home - made festival food .
lam tsuen has enjoyed a long history . the ancestors of the villagers relocated here in the late years of song dynasty , which was 700 years ago .
chung uk village is a small village in lam tsuen , with about 180 residents .

as a major effort to prevent financial risks , the bank has also strengthened the separation of bad assets . last year alone , the bank separated 100 billion yuan of bad assets and signed 21 framework agreements on conversion of loans into equity , with the sum of converted loans reaching 21.7 billion yuan in renminbi .
the new doctrine stresses that when russia itself and its allies suffer aggression , and a war aimed at destroying russia cannot be stopped by conventional weapons , russia has the right to use nuclear weapons .
this shows that russia will be the first to launch a nuclear attack , when it believes it necessary .
the russian military emphasizes that the new military doctrine gives russia the right to take the initiative in launching a nuclear strike against the enemy .
the three baltic states and certain mideast countries are also eager to try to join nato at an early date .
after that , ignoring the opposition of many countries , including russia , and without un authorization , us - led nato wantonly waged a 78 - day large - scale air war against the yugoslav federation .
acting russian prime minister putin specifically pointed out at the recent russian federation security council meeting that the new military doctrine is " a reply to nato . "
this means that russia now regards us - led nato as its " no . 1 imaginary enemy . "
yeshin , director of the military construction bureau of the council , said that due to its economic difficulties and shortage of military funds , russia cannot fight a conventional war with nato for the foreseeable future .
in order to be respected by others , it is essential to maintain nuclear potential and regard nuclear weapons as " political instruments for curbing the enemy . "
all kinds of gang crimes have become a major factor affecting social stability and economic growth .
military analysts here believe that the new russian military doctrine is an expansion and extension in the military sphere of the " russian security concept " which was adopted in january , and is also a " war warning . "
nato will think thrice about taking major military action again that threatens russia and its allies .
nuclear arms will play a still greater deterrent role as the " trump cards " preserving russia 's great power status and vital interests .

bush got 30 percent of the vote , placing him second .
analysts believe that the new hampshire primary means that bush is facing a serious new challenge , and also shows that the struggle for the republican party nomination is getting much hotter .
however , this little state occupies a decisive position during the presidential primaries , and not only can it make the next president , it can also bury the political prospects of presidential candidates .
the situation over the past 10 - 20 years shows that most of those who gain the white house have won in the new hampshire primaries .
his campaign strategy relies heavily on the economic card , energetically touting the economic achievements since he and clinton took office as well as claiming that only he has the experience and the ability to " maintain america 's prosperity . "
bradley tried to turn the situation around in new hampshire after his resounding defeat in the iowa primary , but was ineffective .
gore said that the new hampshire primary was a " crushing blow " to bradley .
the new hampshire primaries have turned the original five - man race in the republican party into a two - man struggle , with fight for the nomination being primarily between bush and mccain .
there he adopted the campaign strategy of " concentrating superior forces , " throwing more time and money into it than any other candidate did and organizing more than 100 voter rallies statewide .
in the polls conducted before the primary , support for mccain exceed that for bush for eight weeks in a row .
during the campaign , bush stated that his large tax cut plan represents the interest of conservative republicans , and that he is the only one with the ability to take back the white house in the presidential election in november .
he charged that mccain 's tax cut plan was similar to that of clinton 's .
he has indicated that he would pursue campaign finance reforms to eliminate money 's influence in politics .
public opinion believes that in new hampshire , independents voters - - who are neither democratic nor republican - - account for as much as 40 percent , and this part of the electorate played an important role in mccain 's primary victory .
following new hampshire , gore and bradley will start a new round of competition on march 7 .
at that time , 16 states nationwide will conduct primaries on the same day .
prior to the 7 march primaries , the republican presidential candidates will also confront each other again in delaware , south carolina , arizona , and michigan .

the focus of this annual meeting is no longer on how to resolve the thorny crisis situation ; rather it is to explore the more basic , long - term issues in world economic development .
economic globalization has made the countries around the world increasingly more dependent on one another for economic development .
the united states ' economy has been the engine driving world economic growth in recent years .
to date , that economy has sustained 107 months of continuous growth .
in the " new economic " era , when information technology continues to drive economic growth , the united states ' economy continues to have growth potential , but there is also potential danger in their stock market bubble and soaring corporate and personal debt .
in addition , china 's economy as a growing force to be reckoned with in the global economy is another area that attracted much attention .

in view of the failure of the minister - level wto meeting in seattle , many participants wondered when another round of multilateral trade talks should be launched .

jordan 's king abdullah ii said in his speech that today more than half of the world 's population is still subsisting on less than $ 2 a day , while the richest one - fifth of the world 's population owns more than 66 times the resources of the poorest one - fifth .
south africa 's president mbeki said that the information revolution brought by the internet has further widened the gap between the developing and the developed countries .

wan guoquan , president of the china council for promoting peaceful reunification , spoke at the meeting .
he expressed the belief that through cross - strait talks , a solution can surely be found that will not only satisfy the wishes and demands of taiwan compatriots but also fully take into consideration the interests of various social classes in taiwan .

cai changsong , deputy secretary of the hainan provincial cpc committee ; hong shouxiang , standing committee member of the provincial party committee and director of the propaganda department ; and li dongsheng and wang qiongying , vice governors of hainan province , attended the forum .
it said : life will only become harder if us forces are garrisoned for the long term in kosovo .
i cannot help but recall two old chinese sayings after reading this article : getting enmeshed in a web of one 's own spinning , and lifting a rock only to drop it on one 's own feet , which truly portray the dilemma in which the united states is caught in kosovo .
last march , us - led nato flaunted the banner of humanitarianism , and wantonly and indiscriminately bombed the federal republic of yugoslavia [ fry ] without un security council authorization .
for a period of time , the us government , public , and media boasted enormously about their victory and were insufferably arrogant .
however , as time goes by , some people have to admit that the severity of the outcome of this war is unexpected .
ethnic conflicts have intensified further instead of disappearing after us - led nato troops were garrisoned in kosovo in the name of un peacekeeping .
us defense secretary cohen flew to munich last week , hoping also to work on the european allies .
he complained : us forces serve as policemen in kosovo but lack the training required , and the us government does not wish them to do such work . the kosovo situation has the tendency to get out of control , and the european allies should shoulder more obligations .
according to us claims , the european allies have agreed to garrison police units in kosovo , and will form a multinational force before april this year to uphold peace in kosovo , so that us forces can extricate themselves .
some people even believe that the united states asked for it since it refused to heed advice initially and had made a mess of things .
people here opined : the prerequisite for the united states to militarily withdraw from kosovo is the agreement of european countries to fill the vacuum left by us forces , but persuading the european allies to help clear up the messy situation is easier said than done .
the united states has always wanted to become the world 's big brother , and has promoted power politics and hegemonism everywhere . if it continues to be its old self , it will not be able to avoid the disastrous roads of failure it took in north korea , vietnam , somalia , and other places .
professor chang lin - chih of taiwan university pointed out in a taiwan tv program that the taiwan authorities have erected obstacles over the question of cross - strait transport links , with the result that it is completely impossible to develop the " asia - pacific operations center . "
taiwan 's chang jung aviation , which is closely following china airlines in establishing an office in beijing , will also soon establish an office in shanghai .
in order to respond to the vast business opportunities in the future when there are direct cross - strait flights , taiwan 's fu hsing aviation has spent a huge sum on buying medium and long - range versions of the european airbus .
as for sea transport , all shipping companies hold that direct routes represent the inevitable trend , and it is absolutely impossible to ignore the important status and impact of the mainland 's vast market in asia .
in the past few years , though cross - strait relations have gone through twists and turns as well as storms , tremendous changes have also taken place in this regard .
all this eloquently proves that the desire of the chinese people to realize the reunification of the motherland is an irresistible historical trend .
hong kong and macao have successively returned to the motherland , and the historic task of striving to settle the taiwan issue and realizing the reunification of the motherland at an early date is now ever more prominently placed before us .
hong kong and macao have returned to the motherland one after the other , and the influence produced by the practice of " one country , two systems " has been continuously increasing .
now more and more people favor " one country , two system " ; since it has successfully solved the hong kong and macao questions , it can certainly apply to settle the taiwan issue .
the " two - state " theory has also been rebuffed everywhere in the international community .
the fact that the principle of one china has been widely accepted by the international community shows that the " two - state " theory is but a lost move by the taiwan separatist forces as a result of their misappraisal of the situation .
the vital interests , major principles , and great justice of the chinese nation require the reunification of the motherland .
it should be particularly pointed out here that the principle of one china is the most important basis of cross - strait relations .
when the principle of one china is observed , there will be an opportunity for the development and improvement of cross - strait relations ; otherwise , cross - strait relations will be bound to come to a halt or even retrograde .
as the first step , the two sides of the strait may first conduct negotiations on the formal end of hostilities .
but the " two - state " theory is a stumbling block to the development of cross - strait relations .
after the return of hong kong and macao to the motherland , the chinese nation will certainly be able to usher in a glorious , historical moment of complete reunification of the motherland .
most of the reports are replete with skepticism over this russian strongman .
the united states , however , did not respond in kind to dissolve the military bloc of nato on the basis of the " common values of all mankind . "
following the disintegration of the soviet union , the russian federation again faced the danger of yet another disintegration because of the " phenomenon of chechen , " which is a nation within a nation . "
we should say that russia 's major restructuring of its external security system is a response , which russia is forced to make because of the west 's insatiable , step - by - step moves to squeeze its strategic space , and absolutely not because of russia 's bellicosity .
the fact is that this theory is nothing but a hypocritical subterfuge . who in those developed countries with strong economic growth and lavish consumption habits have given any food to the starving african children struggling on the line of death , basing on the belief that that " human rights take precedence over sovereignty " ?
the first one was britain 's release of chile 's former president , pinochet .
thus , extraditing pinochet to spain would be an extremely complex and sensitive international event , and britain , after considering the issue very carefully , dared not set this dangerous precedence .
the second incidence was : when chechen 's secessionist force was at the critical point where its very existence was at stake , and sought help , even military intervention , from the united states , the us government , while expressing profound sympathies , flatly rejected the request .
the us government has been strongly condemning russian troops for creating a " humanitarian crisis " in chechen .
if the united states chose to act according to the theory that " human rights take precedence over sovereignty , " then it should feel justify to send troops to chechen , just as it did when it invaded yugoslavia during the kosovo war .
but american people fully understand what will be the consequence of their intervention in the chechen war. they fully understand that it is not in the national interests of the united states .
many world events happening after cold war have vividly illustrated this fact , namely : although globalization has had a profound impact on the world , the core of international relations remains politics buttressed by strength and national interests .
while globalization has weakened the traditional national interests , it cannot replace the fundamental national interests .
the wealth of the united states belongs to the united states . the resources in china belong to china . british patents belong to britain .
national interests are still the basic principle that countries all over the world follow in making decisions or taking actions .
in the early winter morning , the great desert seemed sound asleep , and the whole area was in darkness as our cross - country jeep drove in .
inside the jeep we were enjoying the darkness , because no one could find us .
the date was 20 november 1999 , a day written in the glorious annals of the chinese nation .
our vehicle was so close to the launching tower , and we could clearly see the long arms of the shiny green launching tower embracing a milk - white new type of rocket pointing at the sky .
all kinds of thoughts were thronging my mind at the time , but i did not say anything , i was afraid that the others in the vehicle were in a state of anxiety , for this after all was china 's first test - launch of a spaceship .
do not think for a moment that i , a female in the military , am stupidly brave , in fact i " know what 's what " and i am familiar with the veterans in charge of the spaceship 's destiny .
i just wanted to watch the " shenzhou " soar into the heaven from nearby . . .
wang yongzhi [ 3769 3057 1807 ] is the chief designer in china 's manned spaceflight project , and so far the missiles and carrier rockets designed under his charge have never failed .
it is no surprise that chief designer wang attracts young men .
i really admire chief designer wang 's powers of attraction .
sun gongling 's eyes were bright as he said this , as if he had already seen the spacecraft soaring into the sky .
he quickly added something worth pondering : " a man 's attraction lies in his wisdom and boldness . "
that was in june 1964 , when wang yongzhi went to the gobi for the first time to undertake the task of launching the first medium - short - range missiles developed by china itself .
during the test firing , the missile 's range was not long enough .
the experts considered how to add more propellant to the rocket , but as the rocket ' fuel tanks were limited , it was not possible to feed in any more .
just when everyone was racking their brains to think of a solution , a young lieutenant stood up and said : " if the propellant temperature is high when the rocket is launched , its density will be reduced , thus the motor 's throttle characteristic will change accordingly .
after calculation , if 600 kg of fuel are unloaded from the rocket , the missile will hit the target . "
someone said impolitely : " the rocket 's capacity was already insufficient , yet you want to remove some of the fuel ? "
pointing at wang yongzhi , qian xuesen said to the chief designer : " this young man 's opinion is correct , and do as he says ! "
it turned out that the rocket 's range lengthened after some of the propellant was removed , and all the three missiles launched hit the target .
the iron arms on the launch tower opened up , and the long rapier in the crystal palace , outlined against the sky , displayed its heroic posture .
i knew that it would be wang yongzhi controlling the rocket bundle 's " portrait rights . "
on 16 july 1990 when china successfully launched its first rocket bundle at xichang , he had been the chief person responsible for its development .
i concentrated my gaze on a tall and straight rocket ; it contained a great deal of new technology , such as that used for checking and dealing with faults , and it was completely reliable .
the manned spaceflight project has seven major subsystems , and each system has a chief designer and director .
liu zhusheng [ 0491 4554 3932 ] , chief designer of the rocket , jokingly said to me : " chief designer wang has never asked me if the rocket will work properly , i really wanted to tell him that he need not worry , there is no problem with the rocket . "
that day i told wang yongzhi what liu zhusheng had said . gratified , chief wang smiled : " i know liu zhusheng , he is very careful . "
it seemed that the alarm bell needed to ring for a long time .
at this time the launch tower was completely opened up , and the rocket and spacecraft were all displayed before our eyes .
the three - cabin scheme for the spacecraft was proposed by wang yongzhi .
it means : the orbital cabin is the place where the astronauts live and work ; the reentry cabin is the spacecraft 's control center , and the astronauts sit in there during the launch and reentry ; and the propulsion cabin provides energy and power for the spacecraft in orbit and in reentry .
there were different opinions on this .
the spaceflight departments proposed : the risk of sending up a prototype spacecraft is too great , and we should have a good match to be on the safe side .
wang yongzhi went to consult shen rongjun [ 3088 2837 7486 ] : " we should attach a spacecraft to the rocket , but what happens if progress on the spacecraft 's motor lags behind ? "
and for lieutenant general shen rongjun , deputy director of china 's manned spaceflight , the pressure was very heavy , because he strongly advocated that the first launch of the spacecraft must go into space and successfully return .
his decisionmaking choice was related to whether this undertaking would succeed or fail , and he profoundly felt the great difficulty of his task .
this china 's first spacecraft launch .
minister cao gangchuan and political commissar li jinai know their subordinates sufficiently well to delegate appropriate responsibilities to them ; they handed to shen rongjun the heavy task of the manned spaceflight and let him take overall responsibility .
when the jiuquan satellite launch site was starting construction in the late 1950 's , shen rongjun , who had just graduated from university , volunteered to go to the great desert ; by now he has taken part in and directed more than 50 missile tests and rocket and satellite launches .
he is a renowned spaceflight observation and control expert and also a launch controller of great experience .
this means that he shoulders heavy burdens .
on 4 october shen rongjun was told in a urgent phone call from the launch site that there was a problem with a part of the spacecraft 's control system .
the following day he flew to the launch site and immediately convened a technical discussion meeting on whether to open up the craft to carry out crash repairs .
shen rongjun resolutely decided : " we cannot run the risk in space !
so long as the organization is tight , and the measures effective , mistakes on the ground can be avoided . "
i looked toward the launch tower ; the tip of the spacecraft atop the rocket glinted in the dark desert as it moved away from the tower . 13 november , the spacecraft arrives at the launch site .
the road was lined with tall xinjiang poplars standing up fine , straight , and sturdy in the desert , like sentinels guarding a narrow path . they gave people a feeling of exhilaration .
two days previously , i and he had passed neat rows of hot houses covering 150 mu , where cucumbers , tomatoes , peppers and other seasonal vegetables were growing sturdily .
the car stopped in front of a large construction ; the spacecraft was just being transported in the sun to the rocket general assembly and testing plant . we followed behind and entered a brain city .
commander liu introduced them to me in a very familiar way ; it was not at all easy for so many parameters to be accurate , and i was amazed at his memory ; i even wondered whether or not i needed to put so many hard to remember figures into a microcomputer .
liu mingshan is a good talker ; after graduating from university he left for the gobi , and now he has been there 33 years and has witnessed the launch of 33 satellites from the space city plus various types of missiles and carrier rockets .
i took the liberty to ask : " does your wife work here ? "
i remember her with gratitude to the end of my life ! "
at this moment , the winter sunlight was on his face , and i could see tears in his eyes .
he suddenly reproached himself : " she cried out several times that she had stomach pain , why did i not get her to the hospital sooner ? "
seeing what i was thinking , he said quietly : " renjin had stomach cancer .
i can never forget her lying on the sick bed , exhorting me with her last breath : you must get the spacecraft into space . "
that afternoon i went into the space city history museum ; a photograph of liu mingshan 's wife pan renjin was on an honor board ; a senior colonel , she was smiling , and she appeared young and very pretty .
she was an outstanding technical cadre standard - bearer here , and also an outstanding party member , who had won many awards .
her main work here was to monitor the site 's electromagnetic compatibility .
in accordance with pan renjin 's will , her ashes were buried in the dongfeng martyrs mausoleum .
the desert wind blowing outside the mausoleum brings the rockets ' thunder past the neat rows of memorials , and there is peace after the wind has passed ; it is as peaceful as dreamland .
in a man 's life there is a kind of constant remembrance of gratitude , there is one thought that endures for ever , and there is a kind of person who walks alone .
liu mingshan is now alone , he shoulders the important commission of the motherland and people to achieve the hope his wife voiced with the dying breath - - to launch the " shenzhou ! "
i have come over from the hustle of the launching site , and many times i have seen lieutenant general shen rongjun and lieutenant general hu shixiang [ 5170 0013 4382 ] , who is now deputy director of the installation department , directing satellite launches .
however , they have the posture of generals , and they can disguise their feelings and pull through , until the launch has succeeded .
dawn is just breaking over the launch site , and i am happy to see the rocket pointing at the sky ; " good weather , favorable terrain , and friendly people " are all present , and probably nothing frightening will happen .
shen rongjun and hu shixiang exchanged views , then gave the decisive order : " launch according to plan .
later i found out that the four " yuanwang " ships had overcome seven strong typhoons and passed through many complex and dangerous sea areas in steaming a total of 62,000 nautical miles in 259 days , equivalent to three times around the world , and they completely fulfilled their sea monitoring and control tasks .
at 0630 , the great desert trembled , the firmament shook , and orange flames lifted the rocket and the spacecraft with thunderous roar into the sky and into space .
in his view , manned spaceflight is a life project .
in 1997 , the day after completing the task of astronaut selection , he received an order to enter the jiuquan satellite launch center .
on 13 november , i witnessed a huge iron hook installing the spacecraft onto the rocket nose , over 90 meters high !
tense , my hands were sweating .
is there not a saying : the skilled are bold ?
i also saw here xu kejun [ 1776 0344 0193 ] , chief engineer at the launch site .
the article he wrote entitled " china 's future launch sites should have two big technological progress features , " which was published in zairen hangtian [ manned spaceflight ] magazine in 1995 , was praised by china 's famous scientist qian xuesen .
one is 30 years older than the other .
chief designer qi said to yuan jiajun [ 5913 1367 6511 : " i took part in developing china 's first satellite when i was 30 , and you are taking part in directing the development of china 's first spacecraft at the age of 37 . "
chief qi said : " i hope that there will be successors in china 's space flight , with each generation getting stronger . "
he readily replied : " i have a clear idea of the technical plans and have considered them quite carefully .
i will not only fulfill on time the task assigned me by the leadership but will ensure that it exceeds the leadership 's expectations . "
greeting the first dawn of 2000 , a national flag of special significance was hoisted over tiananmen square - - the five - star red flag that flew through space with " shenzhou " fluttered in the first dawn of the new year , to greet new glory for china 's space flight .
in the last 20 years , china 's science and technology research has made achievements which have gained the attention of the people of the world .
in recent years , some domestic departments in charge of scientific research have shown a notably excessive emphasis on evaluating in terms of how many articles are published abroad .
the evaluation of scientific research personnel by many scientific research departments has frequently indiscriminately considered the publishing of one article abroad as equal to publishing one or more articles domestically , resulting to a great degree in attracting chinese academic articles to publishing abroad .
this means that in a period of 15 years , the number of articles published in scientific and technical periodicals domestically in china fell relatively by 26.2 percent .
in addition , the isi database manifests a notable regional disparity in regard to the number of publications sourced in regard to certain regions . the number of publications sourced to certain countries or regions in the isi database is not in conformity with the scientific and technological levels or overall power of certain countries or regions .
if china 's high - level scientific research results are for the most part published in foreign science and technical journals , due to the factors of cost and channels of distribution , it will be difficult to see that these results receive simultaneous first reporting domestically .
in addition , the national commission for natural sciences funding and the chinese science association have begun a joint provision of set amounts of funding to 100 outstanding science and technical periodicals . this definitely will promote the further heightening of the quality of these magazines .
in these respects , china 's domestic publications at present include only a minute number of scientific and technical journals , which are in an initial stage of development and await strengthening .
china 's scientific and technical journals should additionally fully pay attention to publicity and distribution work .
compared with the complete marketing networks and contacts and advanced advertising methods employed by foreign publishers , the level of china 's distribution work for its scientific and technical periodicals is still relatively backward , and this is extremely obvious in the existing 148 english editions of scientific and technical publications .
what is clintonism , and what does it involve ? [ jin yinan ] since monroe was elected president in 1817 , many us presidents have given their name to a " doctrine . "
the new doctrine of " clintonism " has emerged since the gulf war and the breakup of the soviet union .
clinton is the first us president in half a century to have done no military service .
now in the eighth year of his presidency , he has become the president who has issued the greatest number of air strike orders in history .
what she said when sounding off against joint chiefs of staff chairman powell in 1993 has already become a famous saying in us political circles : " you are always talking about our super military forces !
but what is the point of having these forces if we cannot use them ? "
the fiery albright gave the true essence of clintonism : " use these forces , " so that the world will know " the point of possessing them . "
this then is the post - cold war world in us eyes .
clintonism is military hegemonism in a unipolar world , which takes us interventionist policy to the limits .
the unga of september 1999 became a watershed in explaining clintonism .
at the unga , western opinion universally held that the united states would give a comprehensive exposition of clintonism , which was very much in the limelight .
clinton 's address to the unga on 21 september , however , greatly disappointed these people .
this low - key address caused sparse applause among the delegates , in sharp contrast to his address in 1998 , which was followed by a standing ovation .
it was precisely in the kosovo war , the peak of this military intervention , that clinton looked on helplessly at the inability of his doctrine to equal his ambition .
since production of combat planes such as the f-16 has ended , there was a serious shortage of parts for round - the - clock bombing , and there was no alternative but to cannibalize aircraft of this type in the united states as an emergency replenishment .
a shortage of flight personnel meant that they had to fly when already tired , and it was also necessary to urgently mobilize the reserve at home .
a us air force memorandum said : " the combat units are in a difficult period , there are almost no spare engines available , and the combat equipment is almost exhausted . "
during the " missile crisis " on the korean peninsula , the americans acted contrary to their moves in the middle east and europe by seeking in various ways engagement and negotiations with north korea , in a bid for a compromise .
when li teng - hui dished up the " two - state theory , " he expected the americans to pull the chestnuts out of the fire for him , but they resented the retainer turning into the master .
bader , former director of asian affairs in the national security council , said : " we have not undertaken not to stint the blood of american soldiers . "
when will the us military , which is accustomed to using retainers , personally fight in the vanguard on behalf of a retainer ?
this is the objective reason why clintonism can hardly be swayed by people like li teng - hui in asia .
its caution and restraint in asia are also based on the following objective factors : first of all , there is no organization like nato in asia .
although there is the us - japan security treaty , and the 100,000 troops under the us pacific command , it is extremely difficult for the united states to squeeze the countries of the region together and place them under its standard .
since the vietnam war , all us military intervention actions have been essentially characterized by " speed " and " not getting in deep " and have been aimed at weak and small opponents against whom success is easy , and fought in regions where it is easy to break off .
the peoples nurtured by history , nationality , and culture in asia , however , are completely the opposite of the standard opponents imagined by the united states .
third , the greatest obstacle encountered by clintonism in asia is precedent when , far from achieving successful intervention , the united states has encountered serious failure in this region since world war ii .
here it is not so much the " victories " in the gulf and kosovo wars as rather the lessons of the korean and vietnam wars that play the role of historical experience .
as a result , the americans are unable to apply the iraq or kosovo pattern to resolve the problems of this region .
a number of countries with highly developed information technology [ it ] have emerged since the 1980 's , in the wake of the asymmetrical development of the world information field .
they exploit their monopoly status in information resources and the related industries to impose it control , penetrate by means of information resources , and dump information products in countries where it is relatively undeveloped , so as to attain their corresponding political , economic , and military goals .
this is the " information colonialism " phenomenon which this article raises .
it is exported like capital , as an intellectual property right ; the information business has become a new growth point ; and in addition the development of the information industry is unbalanced - - these provide a hotbed for information colonizing .
according to relevant data , in the global information business , the united states accounts for 92 percent of cpu output and 86 percent of systems and parts , and there are now 113 million internet customers .
in this regard , the french complained back in the 1970 's : the entire french databank field is monopolized by the united states ; and in the 1980 's , japan exclaimed : japan may be reduced to the status of america 's " information colony . "
forty percent of the source of modern economic development and growth comes from the information industry .
output value of information industries of many developed western countries accounts for 45 to 60 percent of their gnp , whereas in the developing countries the proportion is only about one percent , the scope is narrow , and the quality is poor .
thus , powerful information countries switch from exporting financial capital to exporting information capital and imposingly occupy the information field in backward countries , thus restricting the development of national information business there .
at the same time they pose a serious threat to the economic security of these countries .
the progress of it has also sparked changes in the world military scene .
it is also connected to a vast databank which collects information on customers , and when required , this databank can provide the customer 's secrets to political , economic , and military organizations .
by means of an internal sequence code , the pentium iii processor can compare the customer with the information that he gathers and decipher the identity and personal secrets of the customer ; or they can deliberately leave an embedded virus , and install hidden dangers such as concealed channels and codes that can recover code keys .
culture is an important foundation in preserving social stability .
the people of a given nation in a given age are living in a certain cultural pattern and cultivate their own human qualities .
norms of language , writing , beliefs , and morals have formed the cultural circle of each country and nation .
in the information age , information has become a major strategic resource , the information industry has become a country 's mainstay industry , information security has become the most important security element , and the information net has become a country 's important strategic infrastructure .
standing at the threshold of the 21 st century , people do not have only feelings of happiness ; it is evident from the uneven economic development and the countless conflicts and turmoil in the 20 th century that high technology is the core of the competition in all - round national strength .
the developed countries have unfolded fierce competition in research and development , centering around " technological hegemony . "
the phenomenon of information colonialism will become an important motive cause in future war .
without information security , there can be no national political , economic , and military security .
when mankind entered the industrial age , the chinese nation had its fill of the bitterness of colonialism and semi - colonialism , and such a state of affairs cannot be restaged when mankind enters the information age .
we must therefore have full rational awareness and strategic countermeasures .
we should establish the concept of standing on our own feet .
we must establish self - defense measures .
on 11 january of this year , the number of patent applications across china topped the 1 - million mark , and thus china has entered the world 's rank of big powers of patent applications .
china 's patent industry has made considerable progress in such areas as patent legislation , patent protection , and training and international exchanges in patent qualified people in a short span of 15 years .
according to a briefing by a relevant responsible person from the state intellectual property rights bureau , the number of patent applications china handled in 1998 and 1999 totaled 121,989 and 134,240 or an increase of 6.8 percent and 10 percent respectively from the previous year .
of the country 's total patent applications , the number of patent applications by scientific research units and institutions of higher learning increased by 7 percent and 22 percent respectively , while that of patent applications by enterprises at home also increased by 6.7 percent and 20 percent respectively .
an expert from the state intellectual property rights bureau stated : having superiority in patents is an important guarantee for gaining the initiative in competition .
achieving a leap in technological development is an important target of china 's scientific and technological progress and technological innovation and also the only way to expedite china 's modernization .
state intellectual property rights office director jiang ying also pointed out : it will help vigorously push technological innovation activities among enterprises , scientific research units , and institutions of higher learning to carry out patent work throughout the entire process of technological innovation .
this being the case , the key to solving the problem of patent quantity lies in improving the scientific and technological level as a whole on which china relies for its patents .
third , the actual protection of intellectual property rights should be enhanced .
to spark the desire of scientists and technicians for innovations , it is very important to implement a paten - rewarding mechanism . this will help form a benign circle in technological innovation activities among enterprises .
the publication and implementation of these numerous policies has thus powerfully mobilized the enthusiasm of the institute 's scientific research personnel for innovations . as china 's entry into the world trade organization is approaching , patent departments in china are facing greater pressures .
therefore , it is all the more necessary to enhance the quality and international competitiveness of patent work , further safeguard national sovereignty and economic security , and promote social progress .
why is it that the daya bay nuclear power station can be ranked among the best nuclear power plants in the world ?
establish the modern enterprise system and successfully probe the way of scientific management of enterprises in which the state has a controlling interest .
the two 1 million kilowatt - class nuclear power generating units of the daya bay nuclear power station are like two " money printing machines " operating around the clock , each of which creates more than $ 1 million in output value every day .
the daya bay nuclear power station earned $ 560 million in foreign exchange and created 2.3 billion yuan in profits and taxes in 1999 .
with such an enormous amount of profits , is the daya bay power station very lavish in spending ?
when briefed by staff of the daya bay power station , the reporters found that the briefing materials they used were printed on both sides while those distributed to us were printed on one side only .
the sense of cost and the extent of meticulous management of the staff of the daya bay power station can be seen from this !
the joint venture company has strict rules , systems , and execution procedures for all its work , from the procurement of staple materials and the suspension , reloading , and overhaul of nuclear power generating units to the distribution of labor insurance goods and small gifts to guests .
degai [ name as transliterated ] , a foreign expert who had worked in the daya bay power station , said that in a certain sense , what the power station produced was not electricity but documents , because everything had rules to follow and was restricted by procedures .
implementation of rules , systems , and work procedures hinges on man .
the influence of the auditing department can be seen everywhere in the daya bay power station .
the joint venture company 's xerox machines were reduced from 53 to 36 last year because the auditing department discovered that the actual volume of copies printed by the company 's xerox machines was lower than the suggested volume of the machine provider , which was a waste of resources .
more than 300 tonnes of substandard concrete iron placed on the work site of the lingao nuclear power station were not transported out . the auditing department issued a notice of correction as soon as it discovered this .
a nuclear safety culture deeply rooted in people 's hearts , a protective screen more secure than steel - reinforced concrete nuclear power is a clean and highly efficient source of energy .
however , 100 percent safety should be ensured .
it has established a virtual protective screen more secure than steel reinforced concrete - - a nuclear safety culture deeply rooted in people 's hearts .
on one occasion , leakage of lubricant was discovered on a gas turbine after a grade - seven maintenance worker completed the overhaul of its filter screen .
an inspection showed that an insertion ring was missing .
the worker said that he did not receive the insertion ring , but the power station 's strict system of registration of material inflow and outflow proved the worker was lying .
the maintenance department immediately organized personnel to conduct analysis and study and adopted timely measures to eliminate the hidden danger .
since then , an atmosphere has been established in the power station in which people begin with speaking the truth when they want to correct an error .
it is in such detailed workflow , strict rules and systems , and the sense of safety deeply rooted in workers ' hearts that the nuclear safety culture of the daya bay nuclear power station is reflected .
outside the main control room of the no. 1 generating unit , the reporters saw some banners , reading " do everything successfully at one stroke , make every person a protective screen " and " it is safety not the market that decides everything . "
the nuclear safety culture deeply rooted in people 's hearts has laid a solid foundation for the safe operation of the daya bay nuclear power station .
using the nuclear power station to support nuclear power development and achieving continuous development , the daya bay nuclear power station has become the incubator of guangdong 's nuclear power development .
zan yunlong , the major planner and builder of the daya bay nuclear power station , was appointed chairman of the board of directors and concurrently president of the guangdong nuclear power group company .
by then , the building projects of the lingao nuclear power station had been successfully completed , and the main part of the project entered the period of installation .
in the construction of the lingao nuclear power station , the principle of " putting safety and quality first " has been strictly implemented , and quality , progress , investment control has been exercised across the board to ensure that best quality and efficiency are achieved in construction and equipment .
on the occasion marking the 4 th anniversary of president jiang zemin 's important speech on the taiwan issue , the committee and the relevant central departments jointly held large - scale commemorative forums .
they held forums with relevant responsible persons of seven ministries and commissions , including the state economic and trade commission , to discuss problems discovered in the course of investigation , and offered some suggestions for resolving relevant problems .
the hong kong , macao , taiwan , and overseas chinese committee combined investigation and study with the efforts to help taiwan businessmen eliminate difficulties and anxiety , organized cppcc committee members to visit taiwan - invested enterprises and communicated with relevant departments to solve problems arising with taiwan businessmen 's investments and operations .
many committee members also actively wrote and published articles and participated in activities to criticize the " two - state theory . "
the committee briefed the hong kong , macao , and taiwan personages and overseas chinese on the great achievements of the motherland 's reform and opening up as well as its principles and policies on " peaceful reunification and one country , two systems , " and earnestly listened to their opinions and suggestions .
at the time when the 50 th national day and the cppcc anniversaries were celebrated , this committee also invited and received several hundreds of representatives of hong kong , macao , taiwan and overseas chinese compatriots to beijing to attend celebration activities .
the israeli government claimed that the places israel has raided are bases of the lebanese hezbollah guerrillas and the air raids have been a retaliatory act against hezbollah 's attacks of israel 's " security zone " in southern lebanon which caused injuries and deaths of several israeli soldiers .
israel 's air raids have triggered anger and condemnations among all lebanese .
the lebanese government also submitted a petition letter to un secretary general annan asking the international community to stop israel from repeatedly invading lebanon .
the international community , especially the arab world , also has shown strong concern for israel 's bombings of lebanon 's civilian facilities , causing injuries of civilians , and has criticized one after another israel 's such " reckless invasion act " .
public opinion has widely held that , at the current critical moment when the middle east peace process is facing a trial , israel 's air raids not only have worsened its relations with lebanon , but also will jeopardize the entire middle east region 's peace process .
in 1985 , israel ended its invasive war with lebanon . but , citing need to ensure security in the northern part of its country , israel established in lebanon 's southern border area a " security zone " of more than 1,000 square km .
but , things have turned out to be just the opposite . the bombings not only have not lowered tensions in southern lebanon ; on the contrary , they have deepened hostility between israel and lebanon .
on the night of 8 february , after israel carried out the first round of air raids in the early morning , hezbollah guerrillas claimed that they launched another assault against israel 's " security zone , " killing one israeli soldier and injuring two .
lebanese prime minister huss resolutely said : it is israel that has failed to abide by the cease - fire agreement of understanding reached between the two countries in april 1996 and launched the air raids . but the air raids cannot shake the lebanese people 's determination to resist and attack israel 's occupation .
syria , as an ally of lebanon in opposing israel 's illegal occupation , has made particularly strong responses to israel 's air raids .
in december last year , with us mediation , syria and israel began to resume peace talks .
this undoubtedly has worsened syrian - israeli relations , making the prospects of the peace talks , which already have been at a standstill , even dimmer .
the palestine issue is an important link in the regional peace process .
according to the " sharm el sheikh memorandum " reached between palestine and israel in september last year , the two sides will sign on 13 february this year a framework agreement on the final - status issue and will reach a permanent peace treaty in september this year .
however , over a period that just passed , talks between the two sides on the final - status issue have proceeded very slowly and little progress has been made , and currently they basically are in standstill .
it has been learned that , the united states , france , and other parties concerned have privately initiated diplomatic activities in an effort to prevent the situation in southern lebanon from getting out of control .
balance of rights and obligations an important wto characteristic the wto is one of the three main international economic organizations in the world today , and it plays an important role in spurring world trade liberalization , organizing multilateral trade negotiations , handling international trade disputes , and so on .
all wto accords and articles have been adopted by its members through negotiations and agreed on the basis of reaching unity through consultations .
any member must while enjoying the rights also undertake the corresponding obligations , so that rights and obligations are basically in balance .
the wto legal system is basically composed of basic principles and exceptions to these principles .
on the basis of abiding by the basic principles and carrying out their corresponding obligations , wto members can also , under the necessary conditions , make use of the exclusion clauses to protect their own rights and interests .
according to these clauses , when wto members encounter serious imbalance of international payments , or when economic development requires the government to adopt interventionist policies , and so on , they can temporarily readjust their corresponding obligations in order to ensure their economic stability and development .
trade liberalization , however , has conditions ; the wto permits its members , especially the developing countries , to gradually achieve trade liberalization in line with their own economic and trade situation and competitiveness , to facilitate the provision of opportunities for their domestic industrial restructuring .
if trade disputes occur between wto members , they can have recourse to the disputes settlement mechanism , and these will be adjudicated by specially composed groups of experts ; the adjudication has the force of compulsion , and all members whatever their size must be constrained by it and execute it .
this has to a very great extent changed the situation in which major treading nations dominated dispute settlement , and gives a certain degree of protection to the interests of developing countries .
at present there are 135 members of the wto , and developing countries and regions account for 81 percent of membership .
uphold balance between rights and obligations when china joins the wto beginning in 1986 , in its 14 - year negotiating process for rejoining gatt and joining the wto , china has consistently upheld the principle of balancing rights and obligations .
generally speaking , the obligations carried out should correspond to the rights enjoyed ; we will not accept a price that exceeds what we can bear , but must achieve balance of rights and obligations .
since the launch of reform and opening up , china 's all - round national strength has increased , and its impact on world economy and trade has continually expanded ; the wto is incomplete without china 's participation , nor does such a situation benefit world economic development .
in the negotiations for china to rejoin gatt and join the wto , we have consistently upheld the principle that china is a developing country , and that we can only join the wto under the conditions for developing countries .
for instance , during the transition period , taking information technology products as an example , developed countries need to lower their tariffs to zero by 2000 , while for developing countries the period can be extended until 2005 .
thus the results of the negotiations will ultimately benefit china 's reform and opening up and help to preserve our economic security .
china 's accession to the wto , its observance of wto rules , and its execution of the obligations on market opening which we have given in the negotiations will provide still better and still more stable opportunities for other countries and regions to gain entry into our market .
regarding the question of the balance of rights and obligations in china 's accession to the wto , we must uphold dialectical materialism and look at it from the viewpoint of development ; rights and obligations are not immutable .
after china joins the wto , we must become familiar with and grasp its rules as quickly as possible , and change to the maximum the rights that we enjoy into actual interests for promoting our economic development .
he said the agricultural restructuring will be market - oriented , the objective is to improve the quality and returns of agricultural goods , and the restructuring will proceed in farming , animal husbandry , and aquaculture all at the same time .
to succeed in adjusting the agricultural structure , chen yaobang said : first of all , we will adjust the farming structure .
with respect to regional layouts , coastal areas in the east and outskirts of large and medium cities will develop modern agriculture to produce export - oriented agricultural goods .
these areas will eventually become bases that export quality agricultural products .
areas in central china , to give play to their high productivity of food grain , will establish large , efficiently managed bases that produce commercial grain and process grain for feed and other purposes .
eastern china and the outskirts of large cities will actively develop production of scale .
they will also develop intensive processing of livestock products and speed up the pace of modernizing their animal husbandry .
third , we will continue to optimize the structure of fishing operations .
we will strictly control the their intensity and continue to enforce the " zero growth " plan .
bangkok , 13 feb - - the tenth united nations conference on trade and development [ unctad ] was convened on 12 th february in bangkok , thailand .
it marked the first global economic meeting of the new century and was convened under circumstances of stepped up economic globalization , further widening of gap between the rich and poor and north and south , and strong urge from the developing countries to establish a new international economic order .
at the meeting 's inaugural ceremony , people could not forget the unpleasant and fruitless minister - level wto meeting in seattle in the united states at the end of last year .
the result of that meeting fully demonstrated the heightened conflict between the developing and the developed countries in the ways they handled global economic affairs .
the progress in science and technology and information technology has accelerated the global exchange of commodities , manpower , capital , talent , and markets ; this trend of economic globalization will prevail .
judging by today 's situation , economic globalization not only has accelerated global economic development but also has widened the gap between the rich and the poor worldwide .
therefore in the course of economic globalization , it is essential to promptly set up a fair and reasonable new international economic order to remedy the defects brought by the globalization process .
development is another issue facing the conference on trade and development , and as far as the developing countries are concerned , development naturally is the number one issue .
today , the developing countries as a whole have become the source of world economic growth , but fund shortages , backward technologies , lack of qualified management personnel , poor infrastructure , and other problems are seriously hampering the developing countries ' economic growth .
he pointed out : price regulation and control in 2000 should not only strive to bring about an appropriate and rational pickup in the overall price level to boost the confidence of investors and consumers in the market , but also pay attention to monitoring and controlling any signs of excessive price hikes that may occur in some areas .
he pointed out : it is necessary to intensify the reform of prices and fees this year and let prices that are suitable for decontrolling be determined by the supply and demand in the marketplace in a timely manner .
though they are not in great numbers , they do have a major impact on the national economy .
this responsible person said : steps will be taken this year to set about studying how to reform the price formation mechanism in these industries .
for example , competitive grid entry prices will be introduced on an experimental basis in the power industry to restrain the construction investment and operating costs of power plants .
the reform of the rural electricity price control system and the transformation of the rural power grid will be accelerated , introducing the same price on the same grid for both urban and rural areas in phases and in batches .
the price formation mechanism for crude oil and finished oil products shall be perfected to encourage oil and petrochemical companies to engage in rational competition .
china 's civil aviation industry has achieved sustained , high - speed growth since the reform . however , the chinese civil aviation industry 's major indices are extremely low in proportion to the world totals .
in 1997 , proceeds from general aviation only accounted for 0.3 percent of the income of caac - affiliated enterprises .
the civil aviation industry is one of the emerging industries that are capital - and high - technology - intensive and have the greatest potential for development and is also one of the most important industries with a considerable spillover effect .
government administration remains integrated with enterprise management the civil aviation industry is one of the few industries in present - day china that still retain the planned economy 's characteristic of integrating government administration with enterprise management .
it is necessary to accelerate the transformation of civil aviation administrative departments ' functions .
however , china has followed a trend contrary to the development of the world civil aviation industry which sees a constant rise in the unit cost of transportation that causes a corresponding rise in the unit price of transportation .
china 's airfare per passenger kilometer is fairly high by world standards and , still more , extremely expensive in relation to its level of per capita gdp or per capita consumption expenditure . the development of the civil aviation industry not only has not benefited society at large but instead has increased trading costs throughout society .
first , it is necessary to make an early , rational division between military , civilian , and military - civilian joint controls of the air .
fourth , it is necessary to encourage competitive civil aviation enterprises in the country to engage in strategic cooperation and alliance with transnational civil aviation companies .
in order to implement jiang zemin 's directive , a beijing insider disclosed , zhongnanhai has worked out specific plans for the work in 2000 , which include the following : first , it is necessary to strengthen ideological and political building of the leading bodies , strictly administer the party , and exercise management over the leading cadres .
second , it is necessary to step up reform of state enterprises and on the whole put an end to enterprise deficits and turn deficits into profits .
third , it is necessary to step up the building of the legal system , earnestly rule the country by law , and resolutely correct and punish the practices and individuals involved in meddling in the legal system .
viewed from the working plans , figures from beijing 's political circles believe that there will be new progress in this year 's anticorruption struggle .
the attack on sects will be equated with that on hostile forces , which means that china will not soften its measures towards the sects because of us hegemonist meddling .
more than a month ago , the chinese government resumed the exercise of its sovereignty over macao .
this is a great event of the chinese nation , which happened after hong kong 's return to the motherland , marking a new stage in the great cause of the reunification of the motherland .
the solving of the taiwan issue has been placed more prominently before us .
the number of taiwan compatriots who traveled to the mainland via macao by air exceeded 2 million . the compatriots coming and leaving the mainland via macao had exceeded 3 million .
the 8 - point proposal is the inheritance of these principles and planning in the new situation .
the " one country , two systems " principle was first put forward for resolving the taiwan issue , but it was first put into practice in hong kong .
the steady transition of macao and the smooth handover of power is another successful practice of the " one country , two systems " concept .
at present , the msar government headed by edmund ho hau wah is properly operating administration according to law .
the principle of " one country , two systems " is applicable to hong kong and macao , as well as to taiwan .
the issues of hong kong and macao are historical questions that resulted from foreign colonialist aggression against and occupation of china .
the issues of hong kong and macao were resolved through the diplomatic means of negotiation .
president jiang 's 8 - point proposal sincerely calls for conducting negotiations on peaceful reunification between the two sides of the strait on the premise of the one china principle , on which any question can be discussed .
since china could hold talks with the united kingdom and portugal and successfully resolve the questions of hong kong and macao , why ca n't the fraternal brothers across the taiwan straits hold talks and seek a common understanding ?
with the deepening of the great practice of " one country , two systems " and the dispelling of differences through negotiations , the " one country , two systems " policy , which is the best option , will eventually win the understanding of the vast number of taiwan compatriots .
thanks to the cross - strait air service introduced by macao airlines , macao 's role as an important channel between the two sides of the taiwan straits has become more prominent .
regarding taiwan institutions and personnel in macao , they are requested to abide by the macao basic law and not to engage in activities contravening the one china principle .
for a long time in the past , people of various circles and social organizations in macao , in the activities of contacts and exchanges between macao and taiwan , have done a great deal of work for promoting the peaceful reunification of the mainland and taiwan .
in his important speech on taiwan , president jiang spoke highly of the contribution made by hong kong and macao compatriots and the chinese nationals abroad .
we believe that macao compatriots with a glorious tradition of patriotism will make continued efforts to actively participate in the various tasks for the application of the " one country , two systems " , devote their resources to the steady development of macao and play a still greater role in developing cross - strait relationship .
the application of the " one country , two systems " in macao has exerted positive influence on taiwan .
in the springtime of the year of the dragon , flower - decked shenzhen is imbued with a joyful and celebratory atmosphere .
today this place has become one of the mainland 's largest ocean - going container freight ports .
li peng endorsed the success of the port in construction and operations , and expressed the hope that the port will play a still more positive role in stimulating economic development in shenzhen and south china .
li peng said that guangdong nuclear power has achieved great success in recent years , and i hope you will continue to work hard and do still better .
speaking on the development of guangdong nuclear power , li peng said that care must be taken to build the no . 2 plant project and ensure it is up to the mark in quality and capacity .
we are relatively familiar with and have relatively abundant experience in and mastery of the type of reactor and technology of the daya bay plant .
high - tech industry is the industry with greatest development prospects in shenzhen ; last year output value of these industries was 8.1979 trillion yuan [ as received ] , accounting for 40.5 percent of total industrial output value .
in developing high - tech industries , apart from factors such as funds , technology , and talent , it is also necessary to have a good mechanism ; the government 's role in macroeconomic regulation and control is also extremely important in marked economy conditions .
the course of shenzhen 's development has been unusual ; it is the result of the guidance of deng xiaoping theory , the correct leadership of the cpc central committee with comrade jiang zemin as the core , and the common efforts of the 4 million people of shenzhen .
li peng also pointed out that the more the economy develops , the more necessary it is to administer the city according to law .
the state has granted shenzhen local legislative powers , and shenzhen must take advantage of this strong point to do still better in administering the city according to law .
at the close of , he arrived at the jiuquan satellite launch center to undertake science and technology work after graduating from the university .
china 's space industry can be described as the model of development of china 's national industry .
chairman shen had the good fortune to participate in the early planning of our country 's manned space flight project .
now and again , he became excited when talking about the successful launch and recovery of the shenzhou experimental spacecraft .
he said : the manned space flight project is a massive and complicated systematic project that concentrates today 's high and new technologies . at present , only the united states and russia have the ability to conduct manned space flights .
our country 's complete success in the first launch of the experimental manned spacecraft is yet another miracle created by the chinese nation , which relies totally on its own intelligence and wisdom , and again proved that china 's space industry - - a rising national industry - - has exuberant vitality .
funds for the foundation have mainly come from voluntary donations from china 's and overseas enterprises , groups , and individuals that show concern for and support the development of china 's space undertakings .
the foundation will make wholehearted contributions to strengthen the connections , links , and understanding between china 's space industry and national enterprises , and enable china 's space industry and national enterprises to soar together .
the successful launch and return of the china - designed " shenzhou " spacecraft last october marked a major historic breakthrough in china 's technology for manned space missions .
when the good news reached our company , we felt a deep sense of pride for china 's space scientists , who relied on their own efforts to scale this world pinnacle of technology . this encouraged and inspired us to work harder and make contributions at our respective posts .
with the rapid development of economic globalization and knowledge economy today , competition of overall national strength is essentially a competition of technological innovation .
an important reason why we have been able to score such a splendid achievement in space technology is that we persist in technological innovation and are committed to conquering the frontiers of high technology in the world .
we are deeply aware of this when we look back over the course of our company 's development over the past few decades .
the nanjing automation company , ltd. of the china power company is the first listed high - tech company of the state electric power system .
our products have all entered the international market and have achieved eye - catching results in china 's foreign - aid projects .
chi haotian , who is inspecting work in nanjing military region [ mr ] , thanked her for bringing up a good son and sending a good soldier to the people 's army , saying she is worthy of the title " model mother in loving the country and supporting the army . "
after her husband died of illness , she endured all kinds of hardships to raise her son and then sent him to the army after he grew up .
chi haotian told ji rongzhen : you and your son 's advanced deeds have aroused strong responses in the entire army and nation . i am deeply moved by your patriotism and your support of the army .
all officers and men should learn from you and your son .
since he became ill , he has received care and help from the army and all sectors of society in every possible way .
without the love of the army and society , he could not have lived today . i am sincerely grateful to the party and the army !
nanjing mr commander liang guanglie and political commissar fang zuqi joined chi haotian in comforting ji rongzhen .
it is necessary to purposefully carry out an education in patriotism , collectivism , and socialism to help the students cultivate correct world outlook , outlook on life , and values .
it is necessary to actively organize the students to participate in community service and social practice , improve their social experience , and cultivate their hard - working spirit and indomitable will .
it is necessary to actively conduct mental health education to help and guide the students in cultivating good moral character and behavioral habits and to enable them to handle well any contradictions and problems they encounter with respect to study , job skill training , job hunting , and interpersonal relationships . 3 .
greater efforts should be made to reduce the excessive burden of middle and primary school students and ensure success in this regard .
now , some students ' class work is too heavy , yielding great psychological pressure on them . this will not help young students to grow up healthy and sound ; instead , it tends to create problems in various areas .
starting immediately after this spring term begins , all middle schools and primary schools must resolutely abolish the practice of publishing students ' test score rankings . 4 .
it is necessary to strengthen the teacher ranks and constantly improve the teachers ' ideological , political and professional quality .
a determination must be made to improve order in schools and the public order surrounding schools , resolutely combat crimes that harm young students ' healthy growth , and ensure that the students have a quiet , harmonious , and healthy study environment .
the words " all the more " fully reflect that we have paid attention to and respected the opinions and role of the taiwan people .
in other words , in addition to allowing taiwan compatriots to reflect their views of developing cross - strait relations and realizing reunification at any time to the party and government , they may also be allowed to participate in the cross - strait talks .
it can be said that each policy relaxation of the taiwan authorities on cross - strait relations and exchanges was the result of the taiwan compatriots ' contention . it is a fact seen by all that the taiwan authorities ' mainland policy has always been pulled forward by the taiwan people .
taiwan compatriots are also the core force opposing separation and " taiwan independence . "
the relevant taiwan authorities have conducted many opinion polls to support their policies and proposals on splittism .
regarding these polls , only by making in - depth analysis can we see through the appearance to perceive the essence .
this fully demonstrates our utter sincerity for bringing about peaceful reunification .
that " taiwan independence " would only lead to war is not alarmist talk .
compatriots on the both sides of the strait should unite to oppose division , stop the plot for " taiwan independence , " and join efforts to strive for a bright prospect of peaceful reunification .
during the current " vacuum period " wherein there is no way to contain china , enhancing its relations with taiwan , particularly military cooperation , is undoubtedly a kind of restraint on china .
this is of course also a product of internal struggle within the united states .
the passage of the " taiwan security enhancement act " bill by the us house is exactly a " major achievement " of the " money diplomacy " taiwan has promoted in the past years .
we hope the us government will keep its promise and take resolute action , and that it will proceed from the overall situation of sino - us relations and sensibly handle its relations with taiwan . it should avoid losing the greater for the less , spinning a cocoon around itself , and playing with fire and getting burned .
stimulated by these two major favorable measures , the shenzhen and shanghai stock markets rose strongly on the very first trading day of the year of dragon , opening with an exceptionally huge upward gap and going all the way up under an extremely lively market atmosphere .
funds raised through the stock market grew from the 5 billion yuan in 1992 to 130 billion yuan in 1997 and more than 150 billion yuan in 1999 .
the number of listed companies grew from a dozen or so before 1992 to more than 900 in late 1999 , with the market capitalization peaking at over 3.1 trillion yuan in just a matter of a few years .
it can be said that the chinese stock market has developed by leaps and bounds over the past decade to become an emerging market that has drawn worldwide attention .
in recent years , the chinese government has been taking measures to promote the development of the stock market .
with the implementation of a new mode of stock issue , secondary market investors may participate in new stock subscription , based on the market value of their holdings of securities in circulation on the market .
the secondary market used to have a " phobia of new stock issue " in the past because every new stock issue would mean a dilatation and every time there was a dilatation secondary market stock prices would fall and result in a lacklustre market , which would in turn adversely affect new stock issues .
when the new measure is implemented , investors , out of the hope of enjoying the huge price difference between the primary and secondary markets , will actively buy existing stocks before a new stock issue to increase their holdings , thereby increasing their rate of winning the stock allotment lot .
the borrower shall be the head office of a comprehensive securities company , while the lender shall be a solely state - owned commercial bank or any of its authorized branch offices or the head office of other commercial banks .
with this move , securities companies will have more relaxed funding in the days to come and this will be beneficial to their operations in the secondary market .
the new procedures also stipulate that the term of a stock collateral loan shall be six months at the most and that the loan to stock collateral ratio , which is the ratio of the loan principal to the stock collateral 's market value , shall not exceed 60 percent .
any violations of these provisions shall be subject to corresponding punitive measures .
furthermore , this will draw stock investment funds from various quarters , such as enterprises dealing in " third - category commodities , " that have been looking on from the sidelines , thereby increasing capital inflow into the secondary market .
in his letter to li zhaoxing dated on 9 february , helms said he was " aghast " at the remarks made by minister liu xiaoming of the chinese embassy at a news conference on 3 february on the passing of tsea by the house of representatives .
he asked ambassador li zhaoxing to " clarify " liu xiaoming 's remarks that the consequences would be more serious than lee teng - hui 's us visit if the tsea is passed by the us congress .
he said : china has always strongly opposed to the tsea and it has made no attempt to conceal this stand .
first , the bill negates the important " one china " principle and undermines the basic framework of the normalization of china - us ties by treating taiwan as a state .
second , it violates us pledges under the three sino - us joint communiques by calling on the us to greatly upgrade its military ties with taiwan and increase its arms sales .
li zhaoxing said : some congressmen did not have adequate knowledge of the origin of the taiwan issue and the evolution of sino - us relations , especially the us pledge on this issue in the three sino - us joint communiques .
it is hoped that everybody has an even clearer understanding of the situation , and has a clear understanding of their sacred mission as well as the important role of science and technology training of troops in raising combat effectiveness .
we must do well in learning high technology and new knowledge by persisting in a hierarchical and prioritized manner . we must stress putting knowledge into practice , and realize conversion of knowledge into higher standards and conversion of technological potential into actual combat effectiveness .
we must exert vigorous efforts to form systems and combat effectiveness out of new equipment , thereby giving full play to the operational effectiveness of new equipment .
the requirement of " better to let talent wait for equipment than to let equipment wait for talent " raised by chairman jiang zemin must be implemented among military units .
zhang wannian said : we must continue to exert efforts in upholding a scientific spirit and a pragmatic attitude .
at present , we must further straighten the guiding thought in science and technological training of troops , conscientiously do a good job of making plans , set hierarchies rationally , handle the relationship between common and individual characteristics correctly , as well as strengthen planning guidance and training management .
insufficient domestic funds have been made up by utilizing foreign capital ; this has increased the state tax revenue and foreign exchange earnings , promoted economic restructuring and the optimization of the industrial structure , accelerated the blending of china 's economy with the world economy , and created a large number of job opportunities .
our country actually used $ 40.4 billion of foreign capital in 1999 . though we maintained a certain scale in this regard , the utilization of foreign capital dropped by 12.8 percent compared with the previous year ; it was the first negative growth rate in recent years .
in addition to the impact of the asian financial crisis , an important cause was that we still did not quite adapt ourselves to the trend of change in the form of direct international investment .
now , more than half of direct global investments have been made in the form of merger and acquisition by transnational enterprises , and over 90 percent of such mergers and acquisitions have taken place in developed countries .
some of the service markets in our country have a tremendous potential , which are very attractive to foreign businessmen , and they will become new hot places to attract foreign businessmen .
then , we should make vigorous efforts to attract famous transnational corporations to invest in china and encourage such corporations to set up research and development centers here in order to expedite technological progress and industrial upgrading .
shanghai municipality , the largest industrial city in our country , now takes attracting the investment of transnational corporations as the focal point of its work in inviting businessmen from the outside to invest in the municipality .
those projects in which they have invested is large in scale , high in technological content , and strong in competition . this has raised shanghai 's entire level of using foreign capital and sped up the development of new and high - tech industries .
the shenzhen special economic zone has gone all out to encourage processing - trade enterprises to shift to high - tech processing ; now in shenzhen , high - tech processing trade has become a new hot place in which foreign businessmen have been investing .
at a news conference held by the ministry of foreign affairs today , zhu bangzao again stressed this issue further .
he said : china hopes that the g-8 can play an active role in enhancing international cooperation and promoting stable and balanced world economic development , particularly in narrowing the gap between the south and the north .
zhu bangzao pointed out : china has always advocated that consultation , coordination , and decision - making on global issues should have wide representation .
when discussing global issues , it is necessary to listen more to opinions of other countries , especially those from the developing countries .
the spokesman pointed out : china attaches importance to the role played by the g-8 and has always maintained contact with the g - 8 .
it is universally known that china has built its navy mainly by making self - reliant efforts , with imported foreign equipment as a supplement .
people still remember the grand troop review , which was held on 1 october last year to mark the 50 th founding anniversary of the prc . the navy 's three unarmed formations , four missile formations , and two flight echelon formations participated in the parade .
the appearance of the marines in a formation was of particular significance because it was the first time the marines participated in the grand troop review . the formations formed by the marines as well as other naval branches showed the world for the first time a complete force structure of the chinese navy .
meanwhile , the invisibility requirement has also been taken into consideration while designing a warship .
china also has developed " 53h2 - type " guided missile escort ships , which are equipped with " three defenses " capability and an electronic war system .
in addition to acquiring new chinese - built warships and submarines , china also has tried to greatly increase its navy 's operational capability by purchasing the most advanced warships and military equipment of the world .
these missiles , which fly at an altitude of about one meter above sea level , are very difficult for radar to detect .
about 85 percent of major battleships and naval air force pilots participated in the drills . as a result , naval units have acquired training under conditions similar to a real combat situation .
according to investigations by public security , the dead man was li xiangshan , a mental patient from hubei province .
he said : it is the common aspiration of all mankind to prevent the employment of weapons and an arms race in outer space .
as for the so - called " sino - russian joint opposition to an arms race in outer space , " zhu bangzao said clearly that it is inaccurate .
he said : countries that oppose an arms race in outer space are definitely not only limited to china and russia .
this fully reflects the common aspiration and pressing demand of the international community .
he expressed the hope that the conference on disarmament in geneva , as the only multilateral disarmament negotiating forum , should make new contributions to the negotiations and conclusion of international legal articles on the prevention of an arms race in outer space .
hu also sought interests for others who had offered him bribes on many an occasion by taking advantage of his position and had thereby caused huge losses to the state property .
besides , hu failed to identify legitimate resources for his wealth worth more than 1.61 million , which had obviously outstripped his legitimate income .
with the penalties added together , the court decided to carry out the execution of hu ; deprive hu of political rights for life ; and confiscate all hu 's property .
hu 's case of accepting and offering bribes and failing to identify sources of a huge amount of wealth is an extremely serious economic crime case involving a senior leading cadre . the way his crime , one of serious nature , was committed was absolutely vile and has exerted a pernicious influence in the society .
thanks to the cooperation of the relevant departments and the jiangxi provincial cpc committee , the central discipline inspection commission investigated and verified in a timely fashion hu 's serious problems of violating the disciplines and the law and handed hu over to the judicial organs for punishment in accordance with the law .
on 1 february of this year , jiangxi province 's nanchang city people 's procuratorate instituted legal proceedings against hu and accused him of the crime of accepting bribes , the crime of offering bribes , and the crime of failing to identify sources of a huge amount of wealth .
hu had entrusted two counsels to defend him in the court .
the trial of hu changqing 's case has fully enshrined the socialist principle of rule of law that all offenders are equal before the law and has fully demonstrated the party 's and state 's resolve to severely penalize corruption in accordance with the law .
zhu bangzao pointed out emphatically : the chinese government has agreed to taiwan being an independent customs area of china , and under the name of independent customs area of taiwan , penghu , kinmen and matsu , taiwan should enter the wto following china 's accession to the organization .
according to reports , china and the wto members have reached an agreement on that issue , reflected in the council chairman statement of the 1992 general agreement on tariff and trade .
in the meantime , he also explicitly pointed out that foreign minister tang 's visit to iran will not involve military cooperation between the two countries .
zhu bangzao said : during his visits , foreign minister tang will extensively exchange views with leaders of the four countries on further strengthening bilateral relations as well as on international and regional issues of common concern , to achieve the objective of enhancing mutual understanding , deepening friendship , widening consensus , and promoting cooperation .
when answering a reporter 's relevant question , the spokesman explicitly pointed out that foreign minister tang 's visit to iran will not involve military cooperation between the two countries .
now the relations between china and iran are very friendly .
he indicated that foreign minister tang 's visit to iran will make a positive contribution to the further development of the two countries ' friendly cooperative relations .
in replying to a reporter 's question at a news conference of the ministry of foreign affairs today , zhu bangzao said : as a sovereign country , china has the right to take measures to enhance its national defense capabilities .
he pointed out : sino - russian military cooperation is aimed at strengthening national defense and safeguarding sovereignty and territorial integrity .
strobe talbott , us deputy secretary of state , will lead a delegation to attend the meeting .
during the meeting , both sides will exchange opinions by focusing on such issues as global and regional security situation , ballistic missile defense , and us arms sales to taiwan .
foreign ministry spokesman zhu bangzao also said at the foreign ministry news conference held on 15 february : at the invitation of chairman li peng , speaker yildirim akbulut of the turkish grand national assembly will lead a delegation of the turkish grand national assembly on an official goodwill visit to china from 20 to 24 february .
in addition , at the invitation of the government of the republic of croatia , zhu lilan , chinese minister of science and technology , will leave for croatia on 16 february as the special envoy of the chinese government to attend the inauguration ceremony of new croatian president stjepan mesic on 18 february .
he said that the chinese government is very concerned about this incident .
he said : as the network economy is one of the important factors promoting a country 's sustained economic growth , network security is of particular importance .
when amending its criminal law in 1999 , china added explicit provisions to the criminal punishment on illegal intrusion into important areas of the computer information system .
zhu bangzao remarked : the relevant department of the chinese government is actively taking effective measures to really safeguard network security .
any bad behavior on the internet is not welcome .
but in the face of new challenges brought about by the new trend of international capital flow , china needs new ideas on utilizing foreign capital in the future .
last year , the real amount of foreign capital used by china approached $ 40.4 billion . although the amount still maintained a certain scale , it decreased by 12.8 percent as compared with 1998 , representing the first negative growth in recent years .
first , it was affected by the asian financial crisis . another important reason is that china is not yet quite able to adjust itself to the current trend in the practice of international direct investment .
at present , more than 50 percent of direct investment in the world is carried out in a form of acquisition mergers by multinational enterprises . more than 90 percent of such mergers have occurred in advanced countries .
these new changes have ushered in new challenges for china in its efforts to attract foreign capital .
the markets of some service sectors in china have a great potential . these sectors , which have an extremely strong power to attract foreign businessmen , will become new hot spots for attracting their investment .
moreover , great efforts should be made to invite famous multinational companies to invest in china . besides , we should encourage these enterprises to establish research and development centers in china in a bid to accelerate technological progress and industrial upgrading .
at present , 254 of 500 biggest companies in the world have entered shanghai . the amount of contracted foreign capital for their projects has reached $ 9.3 billion .
meanwhile , great efforts should be made to attract foreign capital in the higher grade processing trades .
china has two advantages to attract foreign capital . first , it has tremendous market potential . second , it has a comparatively cheap labor force .
generally speaking , china has made continuous efforts to improve its investment environment . among developing countries , china is still a country with the greatest power to attract foreign capital .
in light of the need for the development of a national economy and the promises it has made for wto entry , china will open wider to the outside world . particularly , it will open up such service sectors as banking , insurance , telecommunications , foreign trade , commerce , and tourism in a systematic way .
these are moves that will provide a fine external environment for expanding the utilization of foreign capital in a positive and effective way .
this is a very dangerous political act on the part of the anti - china us forces in its attempt to permanently split china and undermine the great cause of china 's reunification .
once the bill becomes law , it will only incite " taiwan independence " forces into making reckless moves , thereby greatly increasing the possibility of cross - strait and sino - us military conflict and bringing disastrous consequences to sino - us relations .
the main purpose of the bill , which is divided into six sections , is to supplement and further implement the " taiwan relations act " and enhance the united states ' military commitments to taiwan .
the " tsea " bill is the second legal document regulating us - taiwan relations following the " taiwan relations act. "
when the time comes , whether or not taiwan joins the tmd system , the united states and taiwan have entered a quasi - alliance . once events happen in the taiwan strait , the law will provide a legal basis for us armed intervention .
pro - taiwan us congressmen made unwarranted charges against the government 's taiwan policy after president clinton , during his visit to china , openly pledged for the first time to pursue the us " three nos " policy on taiwan .
since last year , more than 30 of 80 anti - china proposals have been adopted by the house of representatives alone .
the passage of the " tsea " bill by the house has demonstrated that anti - china figures in the united states wanted to take the bill as a new force to contain china .
such containment can also serve as a bargaining chip in developing relations with the mainland .
since entering and hosting the white house seven years ago , the democratic party has not done anything that its opponent can hold against it in terms of economy , fiscal deficits , education , employment , and social welfare . the only thing with which the republican party can garner votes is clinton 's china policy .
according to us media reports , one of the major backstage promoters of the smooth passage of the " tsea " bill was cassidy and associates , the us - based public relations firm commissioned by taiwan .
an internal document of the us department of justice showed that the service fees taiwan paid cassidy and associates rose by 37 percent from january to june 1999 alone .
the document pointed out that a key figure responsible for promoting the adoption of the bill - - gejdenson , ranking democratic member of the house of representatives committee on international relations - - received political contributions five times from cassidy and associates in march 1999 alone .
in fact , since the signing of the sino - us " 17 august communiqu , " the united states has never halted arm sales to taiwan . moreover , in recent years , the quantity of the weapons it sold to taiwan has increased dramatically , while their functions and quality have been constantly enhanced .
to placate the congress soon after the release of the " 17 august communiqu , " the united states announced that it agreed to cooperate with taiwan again in making 30 f-5e and f-5f fighters .
the following year the united states sold taiwan military equipment worth $ 500 million , including 60 f-104 fighters .
while in office , clinton first set a precedent by allowing lee teng - hui and other senior taiwan officials and military officers to visit the united states . in 1996 , he provided military support for lee teng - hui 's presidential campaign .
they fight each other in the form of making a fuss together or playing a duet .
the fundamental interests of the us congress and the government are identical . they are only adopting different means and measures .
in short , when china takes military actions , the united states might assist taiwan . even though the united states wins the war , taiwan will be destroyed in flames of war . there is another implication in oksenberg 's remarks .
in other words , if united states enters the war against china , it will lose its current hegemonist position in the world no matter who wins the war .
therefore , the act does not conform to the interests of the united states and taiwan .
recently , president clinton and secretary of state madeleine albright respectively have issued a statement stressing that the us government will eventually veto the act .
history has proven that the chinese people never waver in their determination to safeguard the reunification of their motherland . it is extremely dangerous for anyone to try to go one step beyond the limit .
if this aggravates tension in the taiwan strait and sparks a war , the united states will not be able to shirk its responsibility for it in history .
a source from beijing said that a central department conveyed a document to the officials at and above the ministerial and commission level , referring the event to xinjiang terrorist activities .
as beijing enters the annual period of the march sessions of the national people 's congress and chinese people 's political consultative conference , armed police and security personnel in beijing are on full alert . witnesses say that " level three alert " measures were adopted at the xinhua gate of zhongnanhai near changan avenue .
a political bureau meeting scheduled for today is likely to present a report on the latest progress on the event , the source said .
public security personnel who first arrived at the site used mats to cover the dead bodies .
tiananmen square was unsealed two and a half hours later .
in the more than 20 years since the launch of reform and opening up , china 's socialist construction has achieved successes which have caught the attention of the whole world .
at present , china 's reform and opening up and modernization are in a key period of carrying on the cause and forging ahead into the future .
internationally , economic globalization is developing rapidly , science and technology are progressing by leaps and bounds , and economic ties between countries are unprecedentedly close and their influence on each other is increasing .
joining the wto will have a profound impact on china 's socioeconomic development and on reform and opening up .
as a result of eight rounds of multilateral negotiations held by the wto and its predecessor , gatt , its member states have greatly lowered their tariff barriers , and this has stimulated the development of international trade and world economy to a tremendous extent .
in the past half century , the weighted average tariff level of the developed countries has dropped from about 40 percent in 1948 to about 3.8 percent at present . the weighted average tariff level of the developing countries has now dropped to about 14 percent .
third , to settle trade disputes between members .
the wto 's dispute settlement mechanism plays an important role in ensuring the effective implementing of wto agreements and settling trade disputes between members , thereby creating a stable environment for the smooth development of international trade .
more and more wto members , especially developing countries , have started to make use of the dispute settlement mechanism ; from the establishment of the wto in 1995 to the end of november 1999 , the wto had taken on 144 complaints , 39 of which have now been settled .
joining the wto and further expanding our opening up to the world will be of great significance for spurring the development of our national economy .
taking the textile industry as an example , after joining the wto , the developed countries will gradually relax their restrictions on china in line with the provisions of the wto textile accord , and all quota controls will be finally abolished in 2005 ; thus our textile industry will gain more export and job opportunities .
continually expanding our opening up to the world , actively taking part in the international multilateral trade setup , and taking the initiative to adapt to the current international rules will help to promote the continual perfection of china 's socialist market economy system and impel the process of our reforms and opening up .
active participation in international competition will help to spur china 's economic restructuring and industrial upgrading , so that we can make better use of foreign funds , technology , and management experience to enhance and improve the management standards and operating situation of china 's enterprises , and boost our all - round economic strength and international competitiveness .
take agriculture as an example .
this spectacular initiative by nato not only signifies the first independent move by eurocorps but also marks the acceleration of the pace in the creation of an independent security setup by eu .
arguably , it is truly not easy for eu to get what some have jokingly called " lieutenant 's command " from the mammoth military apparatus of nato .
during their summit held at the end of 1998 , french and british leaders published a " declaration on european defense , " asserting that eu should rely on a reliable military force and acquire the ability for independent military action . "
in 1992 , the armed forces of germany , france , and three other european countries set up the eurocorps without the participation of americans . the eurocorps is under the western european union and has nothing to do with nato .
at the end of last year , eu also decided to establish a 50,000 - men to 60,000 - men rapid reaction force by 2003 as europe 's own security safeguard organization capable of taking action within 60 days of the outbreak of a crisis .
next month , eu will set up a " political and security council " to formulate policies and strategies for its crisis management apparatus , the rapid reaction force .
even though the united states does not oppose the development of " europe 's unique defense " in words , deep in its heart it has felt uneasy about the tendency toward europe 's independence in defense matters , fearful that if the tendency continues , us dominance in europe 's defense matters will be difficult to sustain .
in the past , european countries have always depended on the united states for their military and security safeguards . the outbreak of a number of crises hitting the european continent in recent years has made it realize the crisis facing it .
especially during europe 's internal crises , such as the bosnia - herzegovina and kosovo crises , eu felt helpless and found it difficult to deal with the crisis on their own .
precisely because of this helplessness , eu has accelerated the pace to establish an independent defense setup , a defense setup that is not " purely an idea but possesses the ability to enforce . "
starting from today , we will run a series of reports by this correspondent on " moving toward a new millennium , " briefing readers on the future expectations of various countries , their strategic thoughts on development , and how they seize opportunities to cope with challenges .
in early spring , china 's northern neighbor , russia , is moving toward a new millennium with new hopes .
for the past few years , russia 's economic indicators have reached the highest level .
in the first 10 months of last year , direct foreign investment in russia hit $ 3.1 billion , 1.6 times more than the corresponding period the preceding year . this is the result of the improvement in the investment environment .
the new russian state duma was elected at the end of last year .
people notice that on the issue of chechnya , the russian government not only has enjoyed support from various political forces but also has brought about the unity of the whole nation . this is a political phenomenon rarely seen for many years in russia .
at the first government work conference this year , putin proposed three major tasks for 2000 : first , formulating strategies and plans for national economic development . second , maintaining the present favorable economic momentum . third , consolidating and improving the state power mechanism .
before that , putin told some scientists and university students at russia 's first science festival , that : " science and technology and education are a driving force for resolving russian issues . without being competitive in science and technology , the country will have no future . "
the russian government has a better understanding of the situation and the tasks facing it .
for the past decade , russia has seen a lower economic efficiency , a decrease in investment in science and technology , and a lack of enthusiasm for production investment , thus significantly undermining the social productive forces .
with the arrival of the new millennium , russia lost a free secondary school education system and a public health services system , for which it strove for many years .
the gap between rich and poor and the growing number of the poor are social phenomena in russia .
while russia 's crime rate is going up , its living standard is declining .
hence , russia first should step up efforts to develop " locomotive " products - - scientific and technological products - - and sharpen its competitive edge in the international market in order to spur overall economic growth .
at the turn of the century , a new and dynamic atmosphere indeed prevailed in russia , and the people pinned their hopes on russia 's future .
political observers , however , clear - headedly indicated that russia is a state full of variables , and that no one dare guarantee that there will be no further major political changes in the run - up to the presidential election , which is 40 - odd days away .
these factors are temporary . a country 's positive economic operation depends primarily on the increase in both investment and aggregate demand .
there is no optimism about these two major economic indicators for russia .
it was also disclosed at the briefings that beijing cracked 21,285 criminal cases , more than half of which were major cases .
over 21,000 suspects were arrested and 2,000 - plus criminal gangs were wiped out .
it was said at the briefings that beijing cracked 526 cases of drug - trafficking , arrested more than 700 drug - traffickers , and seized 138,000 grams of narcotics .
it was also said that beijing carried out raids on over 6,200 venues operating without a license or beyond their licensed scope , as well as venues where prostitution and other services of paid companionship were offered , and closed down more than 4,000 of these according to law .
armey expressed the hope that congress would vote before the end of july .
the lawmakers also distributed a report of findings by the us congressional research service on the agreement on china 's accession to the wto .
the report states : china is currently one of the world 's fastest - developing economies , and it is expected to become the world 's largest market for consumer goods and services .
china 's accession to the wto will provide the united states with an opportunity for massive exports to and investments in china .
citing projections by us secretary of agriculture dan glickman , the report states that implementation of the us - china agreement on china 's accession to the wto may increase us exports of agricultural products to china by $ 2 billion each year .
china and the united states signed an agreement on china 's accession to the wto in beijing last november . the agreement will take effect only after it is approved by the us congress .
from 1994 to 1999 , annual direct import from taiwan rose from $ 1.68 billion to $ 7.02 billion , up by 33.1 percent on an average , and annual export to taiwan from $ 530 million to $ 2.4 billion , up by 35.3 percent on an average .
at the same time , they transferred armed police corps commanders and put into effect a system of rotational transfers .
besides strengthening their missile defense and attack capabilities , the chinese communists recently went further to deploy the israeli phalcon radar on russian - made illusion-76 transport aircraft , thus possessing a preliminary airborne early warning capability .
on china 's unification and taiwan independence , 57.5 percent of those polled favored maintaining the status quo , and those favoring taiwan independence and unification between the two sides of the strait accounted for 13.9 percent and 10.4 percent respectively .
tang yao - ming yesterday held a spring festival dinner party with military reporters from domestic and foreign media .
therefore , the remaining 32 percent of voters who had not made up their minds have become the key to deciding the results of the election .
results of the poll showed that the support rating of the ch ' en - lu ticket , which dropped to 21 percent at the end of january due to the stock exchange taxation issue , gained 3 percentage points to reach 24 percent .
as to other presidential candidates , the hsu hsin - liang - chu huei - liang ticket gained 1 percent , and the other ticket did not show any gains .
further inquiry about the candidates they will likely support showed that those who had not made up their minds would add 2 percentage points to each of the ch ' en - lu and soong - chang tickets and would likely give the lien - hsiao ticket another 3 percentage points .
although the strength of the three tickets was about the same , on favoritism rating , the lien - hsiao ticket stood out .
the poll showed that 39 percent of voters thought that with the kmt 's huge resources and organizational and mobilization capacity , the lien - hsiao ticket , although its support rating has not risen , eventually will emerge .
changes in voter support for lien chan were also minimal , with 51 percent of respondents supporting him and 34 percent not supporting him .
the poll also discovered that voter confidence in the ability of lien , pien and sung in leading the state was the highest for lien chan , with 63 percent of respondents saying that they were confident in putting the state in his hands , and 20 percent saying that they had no confidence in him .
confidence in sung ch ' u - yu was similar to that shown in the previous poll , with 43 percent of respondents saying that they were confident in his ability to handle state affairs , and 39 percent saying that they had no confidence .
in early january , 42 percent of respondents said that they were confident in putting the country in his hands , and 39 percent said that they did not . in the recent poll , however , 39 percent say that they had confidence , but 43 percent say they had no confidence .
hackers are practically everywhere on the net ; government and military core secrets , enterprises ' commercial secrets , and personal secrets are all among the things they peep at .
it is of an intellectual nature .
it is greatly detrimental to society .
a host of facts have proved that the greater the dependence of society on network systems , the higher the incidence of computer crime becomes .
when designing their networks , many large foreign websites had attached great importance to their security .
as china 's major organizations are now becoming increasingly dependent on networks , there will be extremely grave consequences should hackers succeed in their assaults .
our country should develop its own anti - hacking technology and must not rely on imports . " if a lock is bought from others , it can be unlocked by others . "
even in the virtual space of networks , people still hope to have an unpolluted , blue sky .
minister of railroads fu zhihuan talked freely about the thinking on railroad development in west china when interviewed by this reporter .
in their policy decision on major development of west china , the cpc central committee and state council have decided to concentrate forces to tackle the important work related to the overall situation of developing west china , and speeding up infrastructure construction is in the primary position .
at present there are 14,858 km of railroad in west china ; there is a shortage of capacity , there are few lines , and they are of low standard ; there are not many lines from west to central china , and inadequate routes between the western provinces and autonomous regions .
it is estimated that investment in large and medium - sized railroad construction projects in west china during the 10 th five - year plan will reach about 100 billion yuan , and that there will be about 18,000 km of railroad in the region by 2005 .
we should improve communications between the western provinces and autonomous regions .
we should step up the building of international communications .
we should intensify improvement of the existing lines .
the focus will be on completing the capacity expansion of the xining - germu section of the qinghai - tibet line , electrification of the chengdu - kunming line , and the capacity expansion of forming west china railroad electrification into a network , section by section .
fu zhihuan said that while speeding up railroad construction in west china , we should further implement the strategy for increasing speeds .
the passenger train chart for national day this year should embody the initial results in this respect .
for instance , passenger train travel time from beijing to urumqi will be reduced from 60 hours now to 48 hours .
jiang zemin , general secretary of the cpc central committee and state president , wrote the title of the handbook and also made important comments urging the leading cadres at various levels to conscientiously study taxation knowledge and to pay high attention to and actively support the tax collection work .
in shanghai 's renminbi trading market , the exchange rate of renminbi closed by a slight increase today , which , according to a dealer , was affected by the reduced demand for us dollars .
the closing quotation of the us dollar against renminbi was $ 1 to 8.2776 yuan , a slight fall from tuesday 's closing rate of 8.2777 yuan .
as china has fixed its economic goals at opening to the outside world in a comprehensive way , absorbing more foreign capital , and intensifying domestic competitive power , the pressure of renminbi depreciation will not exist in the coming few years , instead , there is room and demand for its appreciation .
he stressed that after entering the wto , china will have a sound equilibrium of international payments , and the exchange rate of renminbi will continue to remain stable .
it is anticipated that the export and investment this year will somewhat increase , and foreign investment will continue to grow as well after china 's accession to the wto .
in terms of exchange rate policy , china still adopts a floating rate system under which exchange rates are controlled and determined by market supply and demand .
thanks to the equilibrium of the international payments , china 's exchange rates have all along been comparatively stable .
a financial expert pointed out that , on the whole , there are three major factors that will make renminbi exchange rate continue to remain firm in the future .
first , the special characteristics and nature of china 's economic growth have conditioned the value and trend of renminbi .
china 's economic strength , particularly the foreign economic balancing ability , has been substantially enhanced in the 20 years of development , so that china is capable of accepting such a challenge as opening its financial sector to the outside world , and is powerful enough to maintain a stable currency value .
china possesses an exchange reserve amounting to over $ 150 billion and , at the same time , after nearly two years of stagnation , the export exhibits a momentum of vigorous growth .
china 's financial and monetary authorities expect that the implementation of the multi - currency policy and measures in 2000 will also contribute to the stability and appreciation of renminbi 's value .
in the meantime , a relative shortage of domestic resources will arise , making renminbi even more " valuable . "
besides successfully completing the mission of carrying out institutional reform aimed at combining the " three types of inspections , " they achieved fairly good results in performing their duty of enforcing inspection and quarantine laws .
in addition , they actively served the export sector and took the initiative in mapping out measures to reduce fees and improve services .
wu yi stressed : faced with the new situation in which china will join the world trade organization , we should expand the role of inspection and quarantine departments .
we should earnestly improve management , rationalize internal relations , and improve efficiency in law enforcement .
wu yi stressed : we should raise our awareness of service and provide good service to the foreign trade sector .
inspection and quarantine departments should draw on their advantages in technology , information , and service to serve enterprises and help them improve product quality , raise their technological standards , and expand exports .
in particular , inspection and quarantine departments play an irreplaceable role in expanding china 's exports of agricultural products .
in trying to expand the utilization of foreign capital , we also need the coordination of inspection and quarantine departments to create an investment climate that is favorable to improving the quality and standard of utilizing foreign capital .
the spirit of the plenary session of the central discipline inspection commission should be seriously carried out and attention should practically be paid to the work of leading officials honesty and self - discipline within the financial sector .
finance is the core of modern economy , he pointed out .
wen jiabao pointed out , in accordance with the actual condition of the financial departments , leading officials must pass " five barriers " which includes barrier of politics , power , money , pleasure - seeking , and relatives and friends before they can really act incorruptible and self - disciplined .
passing the politics barrier requires bearing in mind the purpose of the party , insisting on the basic line , abiding by the discipline , maintaining the true qualities of the working class vanguard , and serving the people wholeheartedly , wen jiabao said .
passing the power barrier means to correctly treat and use power , reasonably use power for the people , manage well the money , stop abusing power for personal gain and trading power for money , wen jiabao pointed out .
the financial sector is in charge of management , use and inspection of credit , bond and insurance fund . under the condition of the market economy , power of controlling financial resource is of vital importance .
the more power we control , the heavier our responsibility is .
we must have the public spirit and insist on principle .
we should by no means be able to take advantage of granting loans to ask for or take bribes and take advantage of stock - issuing and insurance settlement to make power - for - money deals .
passing the money barrier requires remaining uncorrupt , absolutely honest , incorruptible , and completely not getting involved in corruption .
our financial officials who manage money for the country and the people should be able to remain uncorrupted .
they should do their jobs conscientiously and be faithful in the discharge of their duties to let the party and the people rest assured .
passing the pleasure - seeking barrier needs to bear hardships before enjoying comforts , needs to be diligent and honest in work , and needs to work hard , wen jiabao said .
we are communists who should " be concerned before anyone else and enjoy oneself only after everyone else finds enjoyment , " should emulate work contribution and achievement not enjoyment in life .
we should start with the leading cadres to set up good examples for cadres at lower levels .
leading cadres should keep a cool head on this issue and must strictly discipline their relatives and children .
leading cadres should also discipline well their staff members .
leading cadres not only should be honest and self - disciplined but also should seriously carry out the responsibility system of improving the work style and building a clean and honest government , wen jiabao stressed .
leading cadres should insist on principles , should have the courage to manage or challenge a powerful opponent .
leading cadres at all levels should put themselves under the management and supervision of the party organization .
they should further rigorously enforce inner - party living regulations and list investigation of leading cadres honesty and self - discipline as an important content of meeting of democracy practice .
major issues must be collectively discussed and determined by the party committee in order to avoid personal arbitrary decision .
we should accept the social and press supervision .
we should publicize our work system , work procedure and work result and heed the critical opinions of the masses .
deputy secretary of the central financial work committee yan haowang presided over the meeting .
this is an effective way to deepen rectification and reform and to consolidate and enlarge the fruits of education and ensure that the " three stresses " education is not done in a superficial way .
facts have fully shown that the significance of the concentrated " three stresses " education is far - reaching and notable results have been achieved .
we should realize , however , that we cannot overestimate the success achieved ; some of the problems brought to light during the concentrated education have not yet been resolved well , and the task of implementing and completing the rectification and reform scheme remains very arduous .
it should be said that the concentrated education is the " top sheet " of the entire composition , and the thorough rectification and reform after the concentrated education is the " last sheet . "
if the concentrated education was done quite well , but the thorough rectification and reform work has not matched it , the results of the entire " three stresses " education will be greatly devalued .
the party committees at all levels must fully understand the importance and necessity of " looking back , " and make ever greater efforts to grasp " looking back " in the same way that they grasped the concentrated education , so as to thoroughly implement the central authorities ' plan .
in " looking back " it is first necessary to deepen study .
the " three stresses " education is self - education in marxism for leading cadres .
" looking back " is a process of study , enhancement , and unification of thinking , and a process of recalling and summing up , squarely facing the deficiencies , and making continuous progress .
all areas and departments must study in depth the important instructions of the cpc central committee and the important speeches of comrade jiang zemin in close connection with the reality of their areas and departments , and raise to a new level the work of summing up the past and planning for the future .
generally speaking , closely centering on stressing politics - - the core - - we should focus on enhancing ideological understanding and resolving the existing problems .
as regards the existing problems , we must analyze the causes in a truth - seeking way , unfold serious and conscientious criticism and self - criticism , and reach the goal of exchanging thinking , helping and enhancing each other , and promoting work .
we must make full use of the successful experiences of the concentrated education , carry forward the party 's work style of linking with reality , keeping in close touch with the masses , and practicing criticism and self - criticism , and be sure to pursue practical results .
an industry source said that operation of the nuclear power plant marks the end of the period in which china was not able to produce key equipment for nuclear power plants .
the successful development and manufacturing of the main ducts has filled the gap in china 's manufacture of nuclear power equipment . it also has an important impact on the development of china 's nuclear power industry in the new century .
nuclear power is one of the universally recognized safe , clean , and highly efficient energy sources .
taking advantage of its aod furnace smelting technology and its 20 - year old centrifugal pouring technology , it began to set foot in the manufacture of nuclear power equipment in 1996 .
his deeds have reflected the mental outlook of the party 's theoretical workers in the new period and provided profound enlightenment and beneficial lessons for conducting ideological and political work in various military units .
at present , reforms of state and military affairs are intensifying and new situations and problems are emerging constantly . therefore we are faced with many heavy tasks .
party committees and political departments at various levels must pay great attention to the study of theory and adopt effective measures to grasp this work in a solid manner .
yu yongbo said : the source of consciousness in studying theory is a firm belief in our ideals .
yuan shoufang , deputy director of the general political department , presided over the report meeting .
tang tianbiao and zhang shutian , deputy directors of the general political department as well as more than 300 cadres at divisional or higher level of the organ of the general political department and units directly under the department attended the report meeting .
xiamen caught the attention of the outside world last year when it was in a " complicated and difficult " situation .
hong yongshi confessed that the city had not done enough in building a clean government and had not been strict enough politically . due to laxness in education , management , and supervision of leading cadres , some profound problems had not been discovered in time and some leading cadres and personnel were involved in smuggling and corruption .
he said : the city has given positive support and assistance to the central special investigation team in the thorough investigation of major smuggling cases . it must make profound introspections in its future investigation and handling of smuggling cases , and draw lessons and inferences from mistakes in order to be stricter in running the government .
hong yongshi said : this year we will conscientiously implement the five - year plan , and promote the drive to govern the city by law . efforts will be made to formulate rules for administrative law enforcement , and make the government more transparent by implementing the system of openness in administrative law enforcement .
zhang hongxi made these remarks when he spoke of chinese ambassador li zhaoxing 's reply letter to us senator jesse helms at a spring festival reception he hosted for overseas chinese media in new york .
zhang hongxi said : we have hoped for many years to use the formula of " one country , two systems " to peacefully resolve the taiwan issue .
now , some people , however , are trying to instigate chinese to fight chinese and compel us step by step to use force .
they turn a blind eye to things that are very obvious , and refuse to comprehend what is transparent to even ordinary people .
they talk about human rights everyday as if the 1.3 billion chinese people do not have a voice . they treat a few criminals as guests of honor and talk at length about what they call " human rights . " should we not give these people a lecture ?
he said : some of these people have never been to china and are totally ignorant about tibet . yet , they still stand there making criticism . their standards are truly low , although it goes without saying that the cultural gaps between the east and west are too big .
since the report on sentencing hu changqing to death was broadcast by the central television station in its news program yesterday evening , it has become the topic of conversation among people in various localities of the province .

china has decided to speed up internet development .
li pointed out : " after reviewing the relevant transcripts and notes , i have come to the conclusion that there was nothing wrong or inappropriate about minister liu 's remarks at the news conference .
the message he wanted to convey was that if the security enhancement act bill were made into law , the consequences would be even more serious .
the nearest comparison i can think of is that , as an american academic put it , even primary school pupils know that taiwan is part of china , but many political figures do not seem to know this truth . "
in fact , a few us congressmen have made some irresponsible remarks about the internal affairs of other countries , but it often happens they do not have even the basic knowledge .
this has aroused the indignation of the chinese people . the chinese diplomat just told the truth and yet helms and his ilk have flown into a rage . this shows that these congressmen are rude and unreasonable and are lacking in upbringing .
instead of becoming hysterical , it would be better for senator helms to calm down , comprehensively and objectively ponder sino - us relations , and have a better understanding of china 's present conditions .

in particular , the 15 th national party congress , out of a strategic consideration of party building , state apparatus building and the maintenance of a lasting peace and order , gave a profound explanation and put forward even more clear and definite demands for preventing and correcting corruption at the revenue source .
the party committees , the governments and the fee and fine collecting departments at various levels have seriously carried out the spirit of the 15 th national party committee and the unified plan of the party central committee and the state council and have achieved noticeable success in practicing " separation between revenue and expenditure " in revenue management .
this year , all the fee and fine collecting departments will comprehensively and thoroughly practice " separation between revenue and expenditure " in revenue management .
the judicial organ and the administrative law - enforcement organ shoulder the heavy responsibility of implementing laws and regulations and their basic code of conduct and mandatory requirement are to manage government affairs in accordance with the law and enforce the law impartially .
so , to practice " separation between revenue and expenditure " in revenue management is an effective measure to prevent corruption at the revenue source ; and it will play an important role in improving the work style of government organs , cultivating a good party style and government discipline and keep state functionaries honest and industrious .
we should see that there still exist some problems in the practice of " separation between revenue and expenditure " in managing the revenues of collected administrative service fees , fines and forfeitures .
to solve the aforesaid problems , we should , on the one hand , continue to step up propaganda and education and further strengthen supervision and management , while on the other hand , we should formulate and strictly enforce discipline .
once the work criteria and requirements are clarified , the discipline should keep pace with them . to back an order with law is an important guarantee for practicing " separation between revenue and expenditure " in revenue management .
to promote comprehensive implementation of the " separation between revenue and expenditure " provisions , it is necessary to enforce discipline , use the discipline as a guarantee , resolutely investigate violators and apply strict disciplinary sanctions against them .
the supervisory , auditing , fiscal , commodity price and banking departments at all levels should improve coordination among themselves , do a good job in supervision and inspection , resolutely investigate and deal with any violations of the stipulations on " separation between revenue and expenditure " in revenue management , and never tolerate such violations .
the guangdong ling ao nuclear power station built by the sichuan chemical engineering machinery plant passed a readiness review by the proprietor and shipment was formally started on 16 february .

at present , only the daya bay nuclear power plant and the qinshan nuclear power plant have been built and put into operation .
a concerned person is convinced that importing nuclear power equipment from abroad is too costly and building nuclear power equipment at home will be an important factor in developing nuclear power in china .

in no way can such an industry be abandoned .
the united states is a " country on wheels , " whose economic development is inextricably linked with automobiles .
during the 15 years of japan 's fast economic development , the national economy of that country scored a 36 - fold growth , while the output value of its automobile industry increased 57 times .
in contrast , the british economic status has declined with the dwindling of its automobile industry .
sales records of beijing 's major automobile markets show that last year sales of private vehicles accounted for 90 percent of the total sales volume .
but if we develop it with new ideas and by using new technologies , i think we can open a new way .
in the past , the invention of automobiles certainly brought an earth - shaking change to the world .
the reason for pessimism among some people at present is that they have no confidence in our own technologies .
for instance , some of our science and technology experts once visited our big automobile plants and offered to help develop robots for doing the spot - welding and spray - painting work , but the plant managers said that they would not use china - made robots .
under the new opening condition , of course , we need to acquire technologies from others , but what is more needed is technologies created by ourselves and intellectual property rights that we can use on our own .
without developing our own technologies , we will have no way out .
if we rely solely on imported technologies , we will definitely be lagging behind others . can any foreign company give its key technologies to a competitor ?
we chinese scientists and technicians should launch a struggle : we should get china 's automobile industry involved in international competition .
the other is that we have advantages in certain fields .
now , the question of the world is how the world should change automobiles . when it comes to china , the question is how china should change its automobiles .
in addition to the above , we have to solve the question of safety .
to solve the above - mentioned questions , we should understand the different demands and study china 's automobile market .
take air - pollution control in beijing as an example .
although automobile manufactures are concerned about money - - they want to do everything possible to save money - - if the state has a law in this respect , the technology for clean exhaust gas will be developed and popularized .
all in all , there is ample room for development . what is needed is the market 's driving force and the related state policies . but the most fundamental determinant is whether we have the consciousness and resolution in this respect and whether we can concentrate our efforts on overcoming the difficulties involved .
china 's automobile industry as a whole is still at a relatively low level , and because of this , it has less problems hindering its development in the new direction .
to develop high technologies , we should aim high and have a firm footing .
the state will encourage foreign - capital banks to set up representative offices or operational branches in china 's western region .
the state will permit cities in the western region to issue lottery tickets to accumulate funds for the construction of infrastructure facilities , such as museum , stadium and other projects of public welfare nature .
limits on scale will be removed for a certain period . the state planning commission will administer this work in a strict manner .
the state will try to establish an industrial investment fund in the western region .
special and favorable consideration will be given to the western region since the competitive power there is inferior to the eastern coastal region .
the eight major transportation lines are : passages from lanzhou to yunnan , baotou to beihai , xinjiang 's altar to hongqilapu , yinchuan to wuhan , xian to hefei , xining to korla , chongqing to tibet 's zhangmu , and changsha to chongqing .
those projects will be built with state investment and local self - collected funds . construction work will be started in segments in various provinces , autonomous regions , and the municipality . the railways departments will build " three vertical and four horizontal " main lines .

" gas from the western region will be transmitted to the eastern region " to ensure supply for 30 years .
the expert revealed that china is building a great energy supply line from xinjiang in the west to shanghai - abundant natural gas produced in the western region will be delivered to the economically developed chang jiang delta through gas pipelines to alleviate the situation of shortage of energy sources in the eastern region .
construction work will be done in 10 provinces , autonomous regions and cities .
at present , four main oil fields have been formed in tarim , qaidam , shaanxi - gansu - ningxia and sichuan - chongqing .
it has been a fine tradition and political strength of our party to attach great importance to ideological and political work and give full play to its important role in revolution and construction .
in directing china 's revolution and construction , comrades mao zedong and deng xiaoping attached great importance to ideological and political work .
as the party 's general secretary , comrade jiang zemin , in light of the new historical conditions , has made many important expositions on how to do good ideological and political work in the new situation .

it provides some important teaching material for the vast number of cadres and masses to study , research into , and propagate the basic theory of our party 's ideological and political work .
fu quanyou pointed out : combined operations are an natural product of the development of war ; and the combat effectiveness of an army in conducting combined operations has a direct bearing on both the process and the outcome of a war .
our army has also carried out active studies and explorations in this aspect ; in particular , the essentials of combined operations of the first generation , which was signed and issued by chairman jiang , has marked the beginning of a new development phase for our army in the theory and practice of combined operations .
we should adapt ourselves to the development needs of the times , and to changes in the pattern of war ; and conscientiously reinforce our awareness of overall interests , awareness of system , awareness of quality , awareness of information , and awareness of efficiency .
meanwhile , we must step up our work in every aspect of the logistics support of our army , so as to lay a sound material foundation for combined operations .
